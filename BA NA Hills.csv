?곸뼱,Mar-21,2,"Poor Man's Amusement Park Copying Western Motifs Really not much to enjoy here. Granted we were rained out. But, tacky feel to areas modeled after Western regions (e.g.: cliche German town). Golden Bridge is the feature attraction and it feels somewhat less than authentic especially packed with tourists. Get to know your neighbours on the cable car because you are going to be on it for at least twenty minutes.",
?곸뼱,May-20,2,"Stay Away Until COVID-19 is Over!!! As of May 14th, 2020 the park has reopened and is charging full price for their admission tickets even though 75% of the shops, restaurants, and attractions remain shuttered. The gondolas do not run full-time and you may find yourself trapped for an hour until service resumes. Keep this all in mind before visiting.  If you like avoiding the crowds/queues and being on your own then this is the perfect time for you to visit. Otherwise, I?셝 postpone your visit until the park fully reopens.",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,1,"The most boring and pointless place ever The only thing that might redeem this place would be the views on a fine day but even that would not be enough to save it from being the biggest waste of money on our trip. I don't review places based on weather. I review based on what they have to offer. What this place has to offer is nothing. It tries and fails to be French. And what is the point of a bridge that goes nowhere? What a waste of a day and a waste of money. If you came to Vietnam to see Vietnam then this is not the place to do it. If you came to see a tacky, expensive tourist trap then, by all means, go.",
?곸뼱,Mar-20,1,"Avoid!! Don't visit now!!! When we arrived at Sunworld Ba Na Hills we asked various members of staff if shops, restaurants and attractions are open at Sunworld as the entrance fee is high at 750k pp. Everyone ensured us that EVERYTHING is open as normal. After paying full entrance fee, we arrived at Sunworld only to find that absolutely nothing was open - all shops, restaurants, attractions were closed and we felt robbed. The staff simply lied to us to make money and when we asked for a refund they outright refused without giving us any reason. I would give this 0 stars if I could as this made our time even worse in an already difficult situation.",
?곸뼱,Mar-20,1,"Daylight Robbery - Do not visit during this time We came away from Ba Na Hills feeling angry, cheated and upset. The dishonest staff charged us 1.5million VND for 2 entrance tickets ensuring us that everything was open. As we made our way in, 'Hoi An Station' was closed, none of the escalators were working so we had to climb countless steps to the Cable Car. Upon reaching the top, everywhere was closed. It is like a ghost town. None of the actives or features were open. They were blaring out tacky music - horrible experience. Thoroughly depressing.  After a short walk round looking at the faux French & German closed shops and restaurants, we made our way back and enquired about a refund. They refused to refund us and said it was because of Coronavirus. So why did they not tell us this prior to paying? This was nothing short of day light robbery. The people and management that represent this place are dishonest crooks who should feel ashamed in scamming the customer of their money. Do not waste your time or money!",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,1,"Dreadful What a mistake this was, enjoyable cable car ride and thats it. Very tacky, noisy and cliche, could not move for people taking selfies, a complete nightmare of a place with loud loud music blasting out. If you have any standards, give it a WIDE berth, enough said.",
?곸뼱,Mar-20,2,March break bust. We went for a family vacation in March and while charging full price for admission I was surprised to find the majority of the hill had been closed and they had a skeleton crew working. The views from the cable car are impressive but very long and the golden hands were clouded in fog and full of wedding photographers so it was a chore trying to take a decent picture. The beer pavilion was closed as were the restaurants and hotels at the top of the hill. Not worth the price at the time we went but I still had a nice time with family.,
?곸뼱,Mar-20,2,Half the place shut We went up yesterday on the cable car only to find that a lot of the activities and restaurants were closed We feel that you should be told that you will not get the full experience that you are expecting and paying a lot of money to see You should be advising people wwhen they go to buy their ticket that most of the things at the top are closed How about a fair go to those of us who have stayed in your country and kept some money circulating to help your people Honesty at times like this goes a long way,
?곸뼱,Mar-20,1,"Very strange place We went in March when there was no-one there due to the virus but the only things worth going for is the cable car (long and quite boring after living in Europe) and the hand bridge. Everything else is slightly odd and not worth going. It?셲 expensive at 750k per person, especially for Vietnam",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,1,"Overcrowded and overpriced Too be honest we didn't know what to expect from Ba Na hills but it certainly didn't match our expectation! The only attraction really is to enjoy the cable car ride (which apparently is the longest one in the world). The famous bridge with the 2 palm hands was a serious let down! Instagram was a little bit deceiving in that this place is just swarming with tourists! We wanted to be the first people here to get some good photos with no one else but we were told the wrong opening times of the cable car and actually arrived at 8am... already too late as the tourist crowds were in the hundreds! Actually the most annoying was all the pre-wedding photo shoots... there must have been at least 5 couples and camera crew, which really put a dampen on the whole experience as they think they own the area! My suggestion for the park is to open up a special pre-wedding package (for a premium) that allows couples and crew to enjoy the facility before park opening times thus making everyone happy! Perhaps even an option for instagrammers to do the same thing (before park opening times)! If this is already in place then better advertising for this is needed and more restrictions on the pre-wedding shoots not to happen during public times!",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,2,"Very strange place. To start, I have to say that the cable car ride and the flower gardens were great. Amazing views on the rides up and down, but not sure if the flower gardens are just a temporary thing... Feb 2020. The Golden bridge is great to see, the coolest design I?셶e ever seen but is just built for tourists, is smaller than expected and doesn?셳 actually cross an area that needs a bridge... The French ?쁳own??at the top is very random... a few copies of European buildings, hotels and overpriced restaurants. A hot dog on a street stand is 100,000VND and meals in the restaurants looked to be from 200,000 upwards. There are 3 floors of arcade games, half of which do not work. One of the two small rollercoasters was closed for repair and the other one was almost impossible to find. There are maps but no signs anywhere! They don?셳 make it easy to get around, I can only imagine it is hell in high season. One of the cable cars we also went to was closed and only opened at 11.30 (the resort is open from 7am so do not understand this at all) The 4D experience was fun. Some things in the arcades you do have to pay extra for. Overall, the experience was a let down and I would definitely say overpriced. 650,000VND PP. if you do go, take a jacket, it?셲 nippy up there!",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,2,"Underwhelming The cable car ride was the best part. The Golden Bridge is not as amazing as some pictures make it seem and the park is nothing special. When in Rome, I guess, but it's not terrible if you forego this place",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,2,"Should have done our research on what this was before we went We were intrigued about this place due to the photos of the golden bridge, so we thought it would be a cool thing to go see. In actuality, it's a massive, fake, resort/ theme park far up in the mountains over Danang. the only somewhat impressive part of it was the cable car ride going up there. But then many of the other cable cars (there are 5 or 6) were closed for maintenance in the middle of the day, the weather was terrible, and the bridge thing was severely overrated. My friend and I thought this place was the biggest waste of time ever. Would suggest you do your research about what this place is (a fake re-created town with some rides high in the mountains) and what it isn't. would rather spend more time at the beach or time in the interesting, unique Vietnamse towns then visiting this fake monument to crass consumerism.",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,1,"Bad experience Nothing special about this place. A fake looking French village where many of the restaurants were closed or renovated. Had to wait to come down because of maintenance in the middle of the day? Some of the rollercoasters were closed, but no price reduction on the tickets. The weather was foggy when we went so could see anything which also influence my review.",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,1,"Not what I expected at all Firstly, if you don't like crowds then do not bother, it was absolutely packed with mainly Asian tourists. The whole layout of the place is bizarre. You reach the top and the signage is poor. The ""French"" fake buildings are plastic looking and poor quality. There are statues of ""Pikachu"" type of things everywhere, and I mean everywhere, outside restaurants, in flower beds, the Koreans / Japanese absolutely love them, photographs galore. Why would you have these in an imitation French village is beyond me. There is a London taxi cab at the top, along with a Mini, Not bad considering its based on a French village originating in the early 19th century. That taxi has aged well. Honestly, I kid you not, it is bizarre. There are stalls selling the same old rubbish everywhere. The restaurant reminded me of being in a school hall, it was a free for all regarding getting your food, most people do not believe in standing in line. We lasted 1 hour and came back down in the cable car. It is one big fake playground, don't waste your time and money.",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,1,"Horrible Too crowded, everything is fake, the only good thing To visit is the golden bridge. Even the food isnt good",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,1,"Tourist from Vanada Well..At first glance, it looked pretty good. We stayed in the hotel and it was expensive but the room was ok. Here?셲 where it goes bad. The food was awful. We got VIP dinner passes. Waste of money! Suppose to be free beer, wine and spirits until 10. The told us at 8:30 the place was closing,. We arrived for dinner at 7:30 and the food was just about all gone. Very disappointed with the service and the food. After all, they have you trapped up a god damn mountain and where can you go? Expensive and way over rated. I would never go here!!",
?곸뼱,Feb-20,2,"Only reason to come is the photos Sadly, quite a let down. The Golden Hand Bridge and Cable car ride make it justifiable to spend the 750,000d per person but the whole trip certainly Isn?셳 worth it. There is a lot of construction that takes away from the beautiful Mountain View, and the large amount of rude tourists don?셳 help either. The arcade was free but lackluster, and the lunch options are abysmal. We chose the Beer Hall (255,000d for a buffet) but we chose wrong. The only edible things were the fruit, juice, and a handful of the small desserts. Overall a waste of time and money if it weren?셳 for the pictures.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,2,Only worth it for the photos.. Not worth the trip unless you REALLY want pictures on the bridge. The attractions weren't as amazing as it seemed there was honestly nothing to do other than take photos. If you take a tour you get to play all the games in the arcade and you get lunch but both were mediocre at best. You're probably better off saving your money and spending the day at the beach!,
?곸뼱,Jan-20,1,"Kitschy I believe that most reviews I red before going there are written by people who never visited the place. There is nothing left from the time, when French people build their resort there. Everything is newly constructed after 2000 and the quality is so pure, that you can already notice it. The disrespect of the company who manages the resort to the surrounding nature is horrible, garbage is thrown down to the bush. Hiking? No way, guards will let you slip away from amusement park or restaurants. It is expensive and wedding pictures are taken there to demonstrate the social situation of Vietnamese people. I guess it works for Korean or Chinese people who can tell the difference between real medieval french city and this amusement park. They can taste the feel of Europe for $100 trip to the hill. For someone from Europe this is just a huge fake. The only positive thing is the outlook, however you must be lucky to get there on a sunny day.",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,2,Half of it closed. Signage very poor. It was difficult to navigate around park. Half of it was closed. Did not see signage for free shuttle when we left. This resulted in 15 minute walk to car.,
?곸뼱,Jan-20,1,"Awful experience ! It?셲 cold the sunworld but it?셲 cloudy and cold most of the time, Especially in january. Our guide was very nice. If you want just to see the golden bridge, don?셳 take the second t챕l챕ph챕rique. It will bring you to an horrible cheap and clouded Disneyland for Chinese people. Hell on earth.",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,2,"Meh The view from the cable car was beautiful, but nothing else was worth the price. Overcrowded tourist trap.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,"Complete rip off We were there on a foggy day. At the ticket booth they warned us the weather was ""bad up there"" and asked if we still wanted to go. We asked if all the attractions were open and i specifically asked about the alpine coaster, to which they replied ""yes"". They give you a map and that is not accurate regarding what is already built and what is not (perhaps it will be accurate in a near future...). When we started going up we noticed right away some cable car lines were not working ""due to bad weather"". Also, when we finally got up there we noticed none of the coasters were open - we found out later that they are closed during all winter. The french village replica is just weird - nothing to see or do but overpriced cafes and what seemed to be empty hotels. The indoor attractions are only fun if you have never been at any fun fair at all and some of the games have a fee.  Despite the fog, the cable car and the golden bridge are amazing.  I would have saved my money if i had been correctly informed in the ticket booth.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,"Not safe, be very careful Our daily tour to Ba Na Hills was completed with nightmares in December 2019. My wallet was stolen from my purse in the first half hour after I entered. It was a nightmare to find an English-speaking official and explain our problem. We completed the forms, about 1.5 hours later we were directed to the head office. An official there said that they had identified the thieves and found many wallets and phones when they searched for their bags, and another official said they had found the wallet discarded. But somehow they locked me in a room and held me for about 4 hours and did not return my wallet. No explanation was given as to why I was waiting. Finally, he made a ridiculous statement that we should go to another center. When we told them to call the Turkish consulate and tell them about their problems, they immediately brought the wallet. As I understand that the wallets were found before the thieves were emptied, but for some reason the authorities took money and credit cards and made a list on the base of the currency. When handing over the wallet, they handed over the TL, but more than 2,000,000 Vietnamese VND and my credit card didn't given. They won't even ask me sign the documents that they?셶e submitted my wallet. Of course I took my wallet and left without questioning. Because I was not feel safe where the authorities were inconsistent with an uncertain authorization",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,2,"Mediocre Amusement Park We fell for it, and we fell hard. This place is not an old French village as shown in photos or described online. Don?셳 be fooled! This is a mediocre amusement park. The main event is an arcade (luckily the games are free, albeit slightly run down) and a ?쐒ollercoaster??where people are allowed to use a hand break. I actually saw people stop completely on the rails and use their foot to push themselves along! So dangerous!  If you do go, head their early and avoid the crowds of people taking selfies next to literally everything and anything. We were disappointed but made the most of it in the arcade...",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,2,"Waste of time and money! Queues, queues & more queues. I have rated a 2 because the bridge was ok, & the view from the cable car was lovely. After that the whole day was shocking. Far too many people, completely disorganised, queues everywhere for EVERYTHING but because there was no organisation, people were just walking to the front of the queue & causing real problems. The map is rubbish, there are no staff around the park to ask for directions or help. Absolutely not worth the 750,000VND we paid in. In all honesty, the fog up the mountain did put a downer on the day but that couldn't be avoided so also check the weather before you go. It's probably really good if you have children with you, but I wouldn't like to try & entertain a child in over 1 hour queues for everything, including the cable cars to get from one place to another.",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,1,"Artificial, porcelain looking ?쏿ncient French village?? Biggest tourist trap ever I blame ourselves for not doing the research, but it is marketed as a rustic French village. Instead you receive a below average theme park surrounded by newly built generic French structures. The buildings are made to look aged, but instead they all look like they are made out of porcelain, like some areas of Disney. Could go on slating the place, but will end it with this- Text book tourist trap, don?셳 do it.",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,2,"Don?셳 waste your money. Had been quite looking forward to this for the views etc, but was disappointed. The whole place felt very plastic and cheap, whilst being ridiculously expensive. The best bit was the actual cable car to the top and how clean the place was.",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,1,"Disappointing rip off Most of the attractions are either broken, faulty or closed. The cable car and bridge are impressive but really not worth the price tag. Many of the attractions inside cost extra, all in all a disappointing rip off",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,2,Ok The cable car and The Golden Bridge are good but the rest is pretty average. Should've got there earlier or later to avoid the crowds e.g.. at 7.30am or after 2pm. The weather this time of year meant the visibility was poor even though the forecast suggested otherwise (out of our control so not really a problem). You are not missing much if you don't go.,
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,"OMG How/why did I end up here? The gondola up and Golden Bridge was good. But the rest...where should I start? Too crowded and I did not go to Vietnam to visit a themepark, and the last thing I wanted to see was miniature copies of European cities.",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,1,"Highly underwhelming Overall:  I should of done my research, but I didn?셳. I should of not purchased a day tour ticket and skipped this. Vietnam has so many more interesting things to do, see, and eat. This was a very underwhelming experience.  If you want a picture for IG, hire a driver, they?셱e cheap. Get your shots and head out. There?셲 no need to spend a whole day here.  Park: Overly crowded at 0930am. If you?셱e planning a trip here instead of hiring a tour company, check the weather and go on a clear day. Food inside the restaurant is bland compared to other food you can eat outside of the park.  I will not be recommending this for things to do and see while in Da Nang.",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,2,"Day trip to Bana Hills from Hoi An The best time to visit is 9am to 5pm in Winter. The temperature is 10-15deg lower than the base and it it often rainy, mistry and chilly. Carry a pauncho and warm clothes. Unfortunately we were dissapointed as the visibility was very poor and thus could not enjoy the views from the cable car and golden bridge. Its over crowded and chaotic and directions could improve. We struggled to get to Golden bridge and the wine cellar and garden. The alpine coaster which we were looking forward too was shut down due to bad weather. Checking the weather forecast before deciding to visit is highly reccommended. Difficult for aged people to navigate the steep turns and steps. There were escalators at most points which alleviated the burden to some extent.",
?곸뼱,Jan-20,2,Avoid during Christmas/new year's Went to Ba Na hills today which took 45 minutes from Danang. Don't bother going during the new year and Christmas period as it is packed with tourists and the weather makes it terrible for visiting. Entire Park was filled with smog and raining. It was difficult to see what is in front of us or admire the attractions. It was raining non stop today and the entire Park was extremely wet even indoors and within shops and restaurants. It made it very very dangerous with lots of tourists packed together like sardines getting herded to each part of the park to use the cable cars. I was worried that there would be an accident with the amount of people as well as many young children and the elderly. The park itself is not equipped for this weather and the number of tourists that visit. The only highlight is the buffets available which are very affordable and of great quality. I would advise families to perhaps visit in the summer months that way you can enjoy the attractions.,
?곸뼱,Jan-20,2,"Nice place but freakishly expensive Nice view and cool place, but they are building too much new things. 750000 dong to go by cable car to the top and it looks more like an Asian Disney Land. Hard to say what's new and old, that kind of ruined the experience for me but it all depends what you expect. The view is great though and it's a very different place comparing to Vietnamese towns and villages.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,"Grotesque: to be Avoided We stopped to see it on our way to Hue and it was truly awful. Once we got through the long lines, the escalators, the hallways, the elevators and the cable cars we emerged in a driving pea-soup fog, wind and cold rain that obscured everything. We were herded in a mob pushing across the Golden Bridge and couldn't see it. It could have become dangerous if someone had panicked. Christmas carols blasted constantly from ubiquitous loudspeakers. Personnel were wearing reindeer antlers. We found out later that we had actually passed through an ersatz French Village, complete with Carcassonne-style walls, a gothic cathedral, and other ridiculously faked French architecture -- although at the time we couldn't see any of it because of the rain and fog. Horribly commercialized and not worth the time or the expense.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,"DISASTER, extremely disappointing: A French/Australian family perspective We just can't understand why anyone would enjoy this park, let along pay the expensive tickets, food and taxi ride to get there. If you only read this, stay away and save your money.  But if you're interested in understanding our perspective from a French/Australian family perspective, stay tuned:  1. Accessibility and organisation  Disaster, it's a mess, it's over crowded, you arrive with a tsunami of tourists pushing around to get through. We came with a pram and had to get a wheelchair for my mum, bad news: some ramps and elevators but very few and so many stairs it's definitely NOT accessible. Don't bother with small children either.  2. Cable car and bridge  Ok so this is the good part, it's actually a pleasant 20 min ride over the jungle, to arrive at the famous golden bridge with the hands. The bridge in itself is pretty nice but again so crowded. It was foggy when we got up there, understand this is common so couldn't see much but we could imagine it would have really nice views on a clear day, so that's a tick.  3. The ""Theme Park""  This is where things start to completely fall apart. It was so crowded. There is nothing there. You arrive in the indoor ""theme park"" and I put it in quotation mark because it's really crammed space on 3 levels with very few rides with little to no interest. Conditions were pretty bad: The Jurassic walk to show dinosaurs to our kids: shame most of the displays were broken. And to top it all, after such a disheartening day, we tried to finish with the roller coaster, and guess what: broken down.  4. The Village  This village has nothing genuine, it's a completely fake village attempting to replicate some of the clich챕s from France and Europe in general. It's pretty well made I guess but there is little to no interest in seeing this. Again it was foggy up there so we couldn't see further than 50meters, but we actually thought this made the place look better as we thought on a clear day the fakeness would have been more exacerbated. It is takes about 15 min to walk around the village, and you will find hotels, and restaurants. That's it. No animations, nothing to do or see really.  5. The food  Talking about restaurants. I cannot believe Accord Hotels actually runs this place under their Mercure brand, it's a total disgrace to the brand which I know to be reasonably good in other parts of the world. Not in Ba Na Hills. The entire complex is run by Mercure, and you would have thought they would have put their ""French"" stamp on the food by offering quality and diversified gastronomic experiences, well you couldn't be more wrong. Basically all the restaurants offer the same looooww quality Asian buffet food sparkled with some really, really bad European attempts here and there. I guess the best thing you can do is the Lotteria fast food, at least you know what you're in for.  Conclusion  Ba Na Hills seem to be appealing to some crowds who want to get an experience of European / French architecture without actually going there. We understand and respect that. But as Europeans ourselves, there was really no value whatsover. I tri d to think about how they could fix it for the European market but the list would be very, very long.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,Save your money Total tourist trap. So many people you can?셳 get a good picture. There is nothing here that resembles Vietnam - there?셲 a fake French Village and a 30-second little roller coaster that you?셪l wait an hour on line to ride.,
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,"Very hard work Needs a limit on people. It's like a fake Disneyland with twice the people and no rides. You have two choices aimlessly follow the hoards of people like zombies or sit, eat and get drunk at extremely inflated prices. I would recommend you arrive after 1pm when the crowds start to ease.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,2,"Hard to understand what people see in this place As a Westerner travelling in Asia (family of 4 with young kids) we decided to visit Ba Na Hills as the reviews were very good. Reflecting back on the trip yesterday I'm still struggling to understand what the fuss is about.  If you've been on a cable car before then you know the experience - this is just another cable car. It passes over dense jungle.  The bridge. This has to be the most over-hyped tourist traps you can find. It has no historical significance. It was built last year and has a plastic feeling ""gold"" railing with two hands that have had moss painted on, trying to make it look old. It takes you 20 minutes to walk the 100 meter bridge because all the tourists are trying to take selfies. Even if it's sunny at the base of the hills at the top it could end up being foggy so not much to see in terms of view. People watching might be the only attraction here. As far as bridges go I have to hand it to the Ba Na Hills marketing team.... they build something that looks smashing in photos and brings in the tour buses by the dozens but in real life it's pretty underwhelming.  By the way if you are really keen to go you might want to bring a jacket as you lose about 8-9 degrees due to elevation change.  Bottom line - if you enjoy being in a cattle heard of tourists at a jankey version of Asia Disneyland with frankly awful food, then this is the place for you. If you came to Asia to see Asia then this is most certainly the wrong place to go.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,Faux Disneyland If you are local and never have a chance to travel abroad then this is a place for . As for the tourist especially those from Western countries avoiding this place like plague as this is the worse copy of a French Village anywhere in the world where they are selling Eastern European food completing with Eastern European entertainers . If this is not enough to make to vomit then you will trampled by the hoard of tourist from every corner of the world . Avoid this place if you want to experience authentic Vietnamese experience spend your money somewhere else like the Imperial city of Hue,
?곸뼱,Dec-19,2,"Ba na hills Faked up European artitecture, ride 1hr queues. Golden bridge only thing good, entrance is 750 million dong,rest is just restaurants which are expensive and just like a theme park, but only one ride the rest is rubbish. Wax works have pay extra. Not worth it.",
?곸뼱,Nov-19,1,Fake The place was first expensive and not that interesting. There is a fake french village and unteresting attraction. you can pass your way !,
?곸뼱,Dec-19,2,Don?셳 bother if it?셲 raining If you are looking for a cultural experience this is not for you. It?셲 more like a theme park with long waiting lines. Extremely busy and we were told it was the low season with less people. It was raining and foggy so no view but I can see how impressive the views could be. Some beautiful gardens.,
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,"Waste of money!!! Why in the world to make a French village???? Why it could not be something more authentic??? We came from Europe to discover a cheap copy of France??? Anyway, first of all the place it?셲 jammed packed!!! It?셲 absolutely insane!!! You should understand what?셲 going on by the size of the parking. Extremely expensive to get on top. If you think you can get some pictures on golden bridge (without another 4-5 people you don?셳 know) FORGET about it. A big company called Sunworld invest a lot of money to transform stunning scenery of Ba Na Hills in a Disney Wannabe. Save your time and money. P.S. To understand the cues at everything, have a look at my pics. And we went off season........:)))))",
?곸뼱,Nov-19,2,"?쏤rench Village??and Golden Hand Bridge on a foggy day I went to Ba Na Hills mid November. Nature around surely looks lush but I didn?셳 enjoy my visit at all, maybe also because of the weather, it was extremely humid and incredibly foggy! I am European so I didn?셳 appreciate the ?쐄ake??French Village or the Christmas decorations, songs & dances in November. Far too touristic! If you are looking for a Westerner kind Amusing Park then you found your place! Golden Hands Bridge could have been the perk of the day, if only I could see it! It was impossible to see beyond nose due to the heavy fog! All in all, maybe I?셶e been unlucky and on a sunny day the place is amazing but I would surely not recommend a visit if you have only limited time in Da Nang.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,2,"Don?셳 expect authenticity Although the cable car ride was nice and the gardens pretty, this was an extremely crowded overly contrived experience. Our group of European tourists made the decision to head back early to enjoy the real Da Nang and not this fake village.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,1,Awful Don?셳 bother. Just don?셳. It?셲 a cross between Disney land and universal studios- and there aren?셳 even any rides. Complete tourist trap. Spend your money on more thing authentic in Vietnam.,
?곸뼱,Nov-19,1,"Waste of money, totally unsafe as management do not take precautions even in terrible weather conditions I visited Bana Hills on the 29th of November along with my friend. After reaching the hill station, there was no warning or no cautionary announcement that any of the outdoor rides or activities would be enjoyable. As I entered the amusement park, I noticed that there was absolutely no visibility and it was raining continuously. It was terribly cold and there was no point visiting any of the outdoor rides. Anyway of the indoor rides which were worthwhile was to be paid for and separate from the entrance fees. We waited for the clouds to clear and the rain to stop, but it did not.  I am shocked that the management keeps the park open even in such terrible weather conditions. If the weather conditions are detrimental to the health or enjoyment of a person, all rides must be closed and the entry must be barred! And the management should take care of the refunds. But instead, here they kept it open for profiteering at the expense of your customers health and safety! It was so cold, wet all over the place that I ended up getting sick that evening. I had severe cold and fever. I could have ended up in a hospital in the middle of a new country.   I tried contacting them regarding this dreadful experience and no good has come out of it. If I were you, I would give this place a pass as it goes not care about the safe and does not maintain precautions to keep their customers safe!",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,2,"Most random place I ever visited Came here for the bridge, which is packed with people. Not worth the trip - expensive, full of rude chinese tourists and a mix of many different concepts - from French medieval castles to arcade games to Disney princesses - that make it so random. I didn't stay the night, but would definitely not recommend.  View from the cable car is nice and the alpine roller coaster is fun. But go somewhere else for that.",
?곸뼱,Dec-19,2,"Nothing too great really After researching a little more after my trip here, I realised that people were saying that a quarter to a third of the time, Ba Na hills will be covered by fog. But then this means that the beautiful French Village and Golden Bridge wouldn?셳 be as pretty as they?셱e supposed to be.  So for those who still want to visit, I have the following recommendation: Never book your transport or tickets before hand, so that you can check the weather before you are about to head to Ba Na hills, and change plans if necessary when the weather is unfavourable. Even so, there is no guarantee that the weather conditions will not change within the next hour. So go at your own risk!  I have submitted a few photos of how this place looks like during bad weather, just for your consideration.",
?곸뼱,Nov-19,2,"Poor visibility I had to use my imagination as to how beautiful this place was. Bought a postcard. The day we went the weather was extremely poor even though weather quite nice in Hoi An. Raining and windy. If you go take a poncho or get stung with ridiculous price for one. I was lucky our tour guide warned us.  I would suggest not pre purchasing tickets before arriving in Hoi An/Da Nang. See if you can find out what the weather is like up there before booking. It mostly is foggy but we couldn?셳 see much at all and even with ponchos we got soaking wet. None if the outdoor stores could operate making the restaurants very very crowded and a break from the conditions.  Wear sensible shoes as surfaces become slippery and take a jacket, and as mentioned a poncho. Umbrellas dangerous if windy.  We made the most of the day and soldiered on to try and see what we could. Made it to the top and saw Buddha and the temple. Got a picture on the bridge to remind me I have been there. Couldn?셳 see anything from the cable car.  Would also suggest if you?셱e not into amusement parks purchase the cheaper ticket without it included. Great for kids. There is probably one good ride for adults/teenagers. Summer would be the best time to visit for this venue.",
?곸뼱,Nov-19,1,"Don?셳 Waste your Money This entire complex is new construction. Nothing is authentic nor worth all the fuss of driving out there, expensive ticket and hoards of people making the experience just awful. Tour companies sell it to you as if you are going to an area: Ba Na Hill- nope it?셲 Sun World. A theme park, highly commercialized, extremely touristic. I keep seeing that there is always fog so the images they show were taking at god knows what hour because we tried walking the bridge at 9 am, 12 and 2 and it was all fog. Gardens, Pagodas and restaurants are packed with boards of people. Save yourself",
?곸뼱,Nov-19,1,Waste of time Don't waste your time or money on this place! It is jam packed full of tourists and the sights aren't that great. I would recommend marble mountain over this. It was rainy and cloudy the day I went so you couldn't see a thing. Hard pass,
?곸뼱,Nov-19,2,"Packed, overpriced, theme park with props Ba Na Hill was actually mainly a theme park instead of a scenic spot. There is barely anything telling visitors what this place is about or how the famous golden bridge was built etc. What you can find here is weird copy of some European architectures and millions of tourists squeezing through each other for a ""Perfect"" selfie. The Fantasy Park was an indoor amusement park, good activity for a rainy day like ours. This is the place to skip if you will visit it on a rainy day because you probably cannot get a good view of what this place supposed to be about, the view from the cable car and the Golden Bridge.  The admission ticket was 728000 VND, which is very expensive compare to other spends in Da Nang. Most of the facilities here are souvenir stores, restaurants serving poor quality food as most theme park do. Ba Na Hill itself was beautiful and deserve to be shaped as a scenic location, not a location where loads of fake props standing everywhere and tourists pushing each other to take photo with them.",
?곸뼱,Nov-19,2,Ba Na hills Golden bridge and cable car ride was ok . Almost always foggy with poor views (this was from the guide ) . The town in my opinion was a waste of time in my opinion and others in the tour . Would not recommend wasting a day,
?곸뼱,Nov-19,2,"Don?셳 waste your time The main reason we wanted to go up Ba Na Hills was for the golden bridge and the views. We went up on a clear day, not a cloud in the sky. This is another matter up the mountain - very cloudy and a lot colder than at the bottom of the cable car. The Cable car is cool, beautiful views on the way up. Its a long ride though, takes about 15 minutes to get to the top.  The Golden bridge is ok, not as great or big as you imagine. You can barely walk across it with all of the people trying to get the perfect picture...  The French Village is weird. It?셲 not real and has nothing to do there, other than swerve through all of the tourists taking pictures of themselves.  The Fantasy park is not a theme park. It is a three story arcade.  A few of the food and drink places do not accept card and there is no ATM once you get on the cable car, so be prepared with cash.  Quite an expensive day out, I wouldn?셳 waste your money.",
?곸뼱,Nov-19,1,This sucks.. We wanted to go to the golden hands bridge.. But a ticket there costs 60 euro for 2 persons for the cable ride up the mountain.. Once we are there we came in an amusementpark where the creator of the park was clearly on drugs.. W*f is this here.. ( we where also lucky to have o paying again to enter somthing I did not even want to see in the first place.. So we whent back off the mountain in about 2 h..  2h of my life ruined ?쁻?ㅇ?띯셽截? Don't believe the instagram bloggers and there fake life's.. Be real and tell the people what they get when there up here!,
?곸뼱,Nov-19,2,"Well... It gives you a shock From people in northern Europe. Mostly Chinese/Asian and Russian tourists. This place is all about getting the perfect selfie in a weird European/Chinese tourist ?쁟ity??on top of a mountain. If you go here do it only for the Zipline because it was amazing with amazing views and maybe the golden bridge. The rest is unfortunately just expensive stuff almost like you go to Liseberg in Sweden without any big attractions. 750,000 VND entrance nov 2019.",
?곸뼱,Sep-19,2,"Sneaky pricing, not worth the money OK so I will get the review of the Ba Na Hills and Golden Bridge out of the way. As an attraction, it's fine. The only thing I learned about the Ba Na Hills are that the French discovered them and they named them after bananas. That's about as much information as I received. Golden Bridge is again, fine. Nothing special. The day we did the tour was clear enough in that there was a blue sky, but still clouds below.  Tour was pick up from the hotel, a bottle of water, a walk along the Golden Bridge, and basically ambling around a fake French village that also had a kids arcade centre. So for $60/??5, that is what I got.  I booked this trip through my hotel. I paid the lady 595,000 VND in cash. I asked for a receipt which I did not get. She said the company ""would know"". The company used was ""Simply Vietnam Travel""/Turtle Tour. Got to the Ba Na Hills and the tour guide said there are a few people who have not paid for the cable car. I knew I was one of them. Had my money ready and he showed me a piece of paper that had 750,000 VND written on it. This was a bit of a shock. I told him I had already paid the hotel. He said yes, you did. But the cable car is separate and costs 750,000 VND. I told him I didn't have the money and he said I could pay the hotel, no problem.  I arrived back to the hotel where the receptionist was waiting for me and after a very long spiel about how I did not pay for the cable car even 'because the tour guide told her', proceeded to insinuate that it was MY fault that I didn't ask about the price. I was told ""you read all the information, so I thought you would ask me questions."" I had to tell them 3 times that yes, I did read the information, but at the very least, it should be put on the brochures for customers, or in fact the receptionist themselves could have given me a heads up, And not be so sneaky about about. Had I known that the tour would cost 1.39 million VND, I would not of gone on the tour. That's not even hindsight. Looking at the brochure and reading about it, it's definitely not worth that amount of money. For 595,000, yes it would be an OK day out.  I'm assuming the tour company gets a cut of the 795,000 VND? And that's why they are so reluctant to tell the visitors/tourists/PAYING CUSTOMERS on their information? Don't be fooled into thinking you have to get the more expensive option.  I am very disappointed in Simply Vietnam Tours and my hotel. I think your pricing information is very misleading. The tour is not worth the money. And you need to be more honest and frank about it.  I think it would be better and work out cheaper if people drove up there themselves or even ordered a Grab. There are no time constraints then and you can do whatever you want. The tour guides main job is to tell you where the meeting point is. So they are not really even needed.",
?곸뼱,Nov-19,1,"Worst experience ever My experience with this place is so bad that I don't even want to write.  briefly writing. half of the attractions in the fantasy world are closed, nobody informs about this when buying a ticket. when trying to make a complaint, the Manager sees no problem because it is low season  I never recommend it again",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,1,"Daylight robbery - did not tell us the cable car was closed and we paid for that alone!! We are so gutted about our trip! We got to ba na hills and everything looks great! Already for Halloween - very open etc! What they failed to tell you before you parted with your money is that the hand bridge is closed - the main reason we came. We realised the weather wasn?셳 great but on other reviews it says it is still open. It?셲 okay to close for safety reasons, totally. But say that on entrance!!! Before you part with your money. The rest is some strange French fake buildings and a small three rides in ?쁣antasy world?? I imagine this trip is great in the sun - but who can guarantee that?! So gutted we just left as didn?셳 want to pay over priced food!",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,1,"Not worth a visit If you want to take photo for Instagram and ok to pay overpriced ticket, it is recommended. Other amenities are all below my expectations. I wouldn?셳 go back there again.",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,1,"Overpriced tourist trap. Overpriced tourist trap. This place is built to attract tourists, and succeeds to do so, but mainly asians(korean and chinese mostly) who are rude, blocks all paths with taking huge amounts of pictures and so on. The best part is the cablecart when coming or leaving. So skip this tourist trap, especially if it is cloudy.",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,2,"Words fail me!! We were recommended Ba Na on the basis of the cable car ride alone and to be honest, the ride down was very picturesque and enjoyable - you can see a huge area of forest and it?셲 beautiful; the ride up was not so good as we shared a cabin with 8 excitable young locals who screamed and shouted pretty much the entire journey up.  Having read the reviews we arrived shortly after 9am (by Grab taxi) in the hope of beating the coach parties; we were only moderately successful here. There was a substantial queue in the Hoi An station (large coach parties) and we were directed to the Toc Tien station. After about a 35 minutes queue we got into a cable car.  At the top there is an explosion of European history and architecture; Bavarian castle, french chateau, gothic churches, Roman and Greek statues etc plus, when we were there, Halloween decorations and entertainment. It was pretty busy with tourists, a huge number taking vast numbers of selfies, videos etc.  We had intended on getting the Hoi An cable car up to go to the golden bridge first but as we were at the other end of the village, we thought before we went to the bridge we?셝 have a quick walk around the village and also have a go on the Alpine coaster - a luge run down the hill (there are 2 coasters each with 2 tracks). We were lucky in that one was just opening as we arrived so there was no queue. The other had a substantial queue and as we watched we saw people going down at less than a snails pace and saw a couple of carts collide due to the slow speed of some drivers. Luckily we were asked how fast we wanted to go (fast) so we were allowed to wait until the previous person had all but finished - the ride at speed is great fun.  Once we finished the alpine coaster, we decided to go to the golden bridge which was impressive with good views (albeit slightly cloudy) and not horrifically busy (although again loads of people taking selfies blocking the walkway and getting cross if you tried to walk past).  By now, we decided we?셝 had enough and descended in the cable car which was very enjoyable. Our Grab taxi driver met us in the car park - BTW we have used Grab all over Vietnam and they have been very good - really recommend using them.  Overall, I wouldn?셳 recommend Ba Na .... especially when there are so many genuine Vietnamese sites to explore. However if you want Disney crassness this place has it in spades. And the views out down the mountain are very impressive. I?셶e given it 2 stars for views and alpine coaster.",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,1,Not worth it The place is packed. The amusement park is lame. The park has many beautiful areas to take photos and it seems like the purpose of the place is to take photos for instagram,
?곸뼱,Oct-19,2,"Horrible cable-car staffs!!! Hello, my name is Phng, I am a tour guide. Banahills is a nice destination but there are some staffs make it a bad place for visting because of their poor behaviour to clients. The staffs in Thoc Tien Gate is forcing visitors to 1 cable car. From my point of view, their action show that customers are like piggies which need to be push to go. I am too disappointed and may be because you are so big that you may not even concern my review but I hope you can improve your service by time. Thanks for reading.",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,1,Underwhelming and packed with Chinese tourists Very underwhelming. Park opens at 7am but most food places don't open until 0930. Hardly any vegetarian or vegan options when they are open. And really not that much to do when you're there. Vinpearl land is far from perfect but it's almost much better than this place,
?곸뼱,Oct-19,2,"A little fake French Village I was told that Bana hills was a must visit in Da Nang and so despite some misgivings we went .. The price of the ticket is quite high ...  The visit to Bana Hills begins with. Cable car ride to the top of a mountain .. it was perhaps the longest cable car ride in the world .. that goes over the most spectacular forest and vegetation , beautiful natural scenery and stunning view , 200 species of animals, birds are there in the forest below ..... U go over the clouds that are lovely .. u feel u are in another world ...and you are full of expectation when u land .., to explore further what Bana Hill holds  Unfortunately the rest of the experience does not live up to that expectation . A French man discovered the mountain top and to commemorate him they have built a fake French village on the mountain top with an underground entertainment centre with games and rides . There are pagodas and towers , restaurants and eateries , shops and a number of newly built temples and newly made Buddhas all are juxtaposition against this French village.. The French ruled Vietnam for a 100 years and oppressed the country .. why would anybody want to commemorate an oppressor I dont know . But it was sad to see such hard commercialisation in this country  The golden bridge was good ..with a giant hand holding a bridge . It is the most iconic image of Vietnam .. it is novel and unusual .. as is the celebration of the physical body with Hugh body parts as sculptures .. Despite all this I came back disappointed.. it was all so fake and commercial ...",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,2,Packed full of Chinese taking selfies We went to see The Golden Bridge but couldn?셳 even get on it at one point due to the number of people on it taking selfies. Everyone goes here to take selfies - it is packed and mad and not a pleasant day out. It is hustle and bustle and ignorant Chinese and Japanese people pushing and shoving to get their selfie. The cable car Ross is superb but the resort at the top is exactly that - it is a theme park - it is not like Langkawi or Penang where the top of the hill has been used to show off the natural beauty surrounding the views. It is full of fake buildings and money making shops and cafes. Do not go unless you are desperate for a photo of the Golden Bridge .,
?곸뼱,Oct-19,2,"A waste of time and money While the cable car ride is fun and the scenery is great, the place itself is a nonsense accumulation of wannabe European kitsch and tourist rip off. If you know the real classic Europe, you may suffer..",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,1,"Beautiful place that is greatly over developed and crowded I have been to Hoi An approximately 20 times and recently went to Ba Na Hills. The tram ride up was beautiful, providing a wonderful view of the jungle on the mountains. Once at the top, the crowds were crushing. We were jammed, pushed and pulled, even though we had arrived within 15 minutes of the opening and it was low season. It is a beautiful place, but terribly over developed with an amusement park and complete lack of respect for its natural beauty. All four in our party couldn?셳 wait to leave and were greatly disappointed with what has been built there. There are many other wonderful things to do in Hoi An. I?셝 definitely take a pass on this one.",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,2,"Funny place We were drawn here because of Instagram pictures on golden hands bridge. It turned out to be very very crowded. And there is no place to take a full view picture.  Apparently most local came here for theme park Sunworld, which tries hard to mimic Europe, Universal, Disneyland, Madame Tussaud?셲 etc. yea... why can one place be like so many others? It?셲 just weird...",
?곸뼱,Oct-19,1,So fake. Be Na Hills is expensive. We only wanted to go to the bridge but you have to buy a ticket to do all the 5 levels. Big let down as it's so fake.,
?곸뼱,Oct-19,2,Fake experience. Theme park reality. This destination didn?셳 meet my expectations at all. I have found reviews misleading and wasn?셳 expecting such a concrete Instagram themed over crowded and pushy day out. Not to mention the expense.,
?곸뼱,Oct-19,1,"Tourist trap It?셲 very hard to find accurate information on this as a destination and daytrip. We couldn?셳 understand why all the tour prices were so expensive.  This is not a serene place of beauty. The French Village that originally stood here in the early 1900?셲 is long gone - destroyed during the war, I understand. A tourism / property development company has created a theme park with the bridge as a key attraction. Loads of little vignettes and spots to take a photo with crowds and crowds of other people shoving and jostling for a vacant spot to get the perfect Instagram photo.  It?셲 tacky / touristic / crowded / expensive / pushy. We left HoiAn just after 7am to avoid crowds but they were already here anyway.  To say I?셫 disappointed at not being able to work out this attraction as it was is an understatement. Clearly I was looking at information with rose coloured glasses because I didn?셳 realize the Sunland Theme Park WAS the golden bridge and French village. Live and learn.",
?곸뼱,Sep-19,1,Staff Staff was rude when talking to support guest. She still sat and stuck her hand in her pocket during the communication and blamed guest?셲 fault. Bad service!,
?곸뼱,Sep-19,1,"god awful this place is truly weird. it's a series of fake selfie opportunities. thought the ""golden bridge"" would be bigger and the hands would be made of stone - nope plastic.  you definitely do not need a full day.  the cable car view is beautiful though and there are some huge butterflies at the top which are pretty",
?곸뼱,Sep-19,2,"Too busy fake experience The hills and the cable car are beautiful, and the bridge is very impressive.  Admittedly we didn?셳 do a lot of research, just wanted to see the bridge. Looking back, we should?셶e gotten a private car and gone very early.  We got there about 9:30am, and despite being low season, the place was insanely busy.  It?셲 effectively a fake place built for tourist photos...  Would not recommend if you want a cultural experience.",
?곸뼱,Sep-19,1,"Crooked cashiers, please check your change if you pay cash! I purchased a gift at the gift store in Ba Na Hills, the cashier was shady and purposely gave me the wrong change. I told her this is not right and she pretended not to comprehend. She knew I did not speak Vietnamese and knew I was a tourist and thought I would be confused. I called my mom over since she speaks Vietnamese and as soon as she saw my mother come, she immediately swapped out the cash and gave me the correct change. I?셫 just surprised this would happen at such a beautiful place that looks like they would want more tourists to come back. Not only that, but it was also raining so we asked what was the cheapest rain poncho and she pointed to the more pricer one and right next to the pile were the cheaper ones. Be cautious of the change as they think you may be confused like with a 2000 vs 20.000 dong. This has occurred to me at multiple places not just here. Other than that incident, it?셲 a beautiful when you go up on the cables.",
?곸뼱,Sep-19,2,"It's just a low budget theme park! Not what I expected. I was sold a day which I thought was to see an amazing bridge and some sights and a couple of optional hours at a theme park. It is actually a day at a theme park which compared to European ones is poor at best. The bridge was built 1 year ago as a money making project, its OK but not what I thought. The rest of the day you are left to go round the park. The only good bit was the cable car which is impressive. Save your money, way way over priced at over 짙50!",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,"Beware of pick pockets Pick your day huge crowds, our friends had their bag slashed and wallet stolen whilst on bridge with hands. So many crowds. Best part was gondola ride.",
?곸뼱,Sep-19,2,First major disappointment in Vietnam The cable car ride is the highlight of the trip. We did not come to Vietnam to see fake buildings. The amusement park will disappoint anyone over the age of 12. In fairness we came on a cloudy day and had some rain but our recommendation would be to give this a skip and enjoy one of the many unique and authentic Vietnam experiences.,
?곸뼱,Aug-19,2,"Vietnam Disneyland Avoid this place! We thought there would be some element of historic or authentic value however this is a very kitch, twee, cheesy attraction. If you enjoy taking selfies in front of fake French buildings then I highly recommend. The cable car and views from the temple were amazing however it was so full of tourists that you could barely see the golden bridge. Piped music was heard throughout and sausage on a stick was being pushed with a vengeance. Overall if you enjoy natural Vietnam there are better places to see.",
?곸뼱,Aug-19,2,"Not much to like The chairlift was about the only really good thing about this place. It is just over 5km long. A nice view going up or down the mountain.  Now for the rest of it. I suppose if you like theme parks, go here. If you don?셳, keep away. The hand bridge is what we wanted to see the most. It is good but is not an impressive bridge like I thought it was going to be. It is new and has absolutely no history to it. The wine area is ok but the rest of the area is not for me. I am sure others will like this place but we cut our tour short so we could get out of there.",
?곸뼱,Aug-19,1,"Weird beyond belief We decided to go here to see golden bridge and stay overnight. On a positive note It was great we saw the golden bridge, the cable car ride, the views from pagoda and........well those 3 anyway The rest was like some LSD fuelled bad trip with home-made Disney. After the streaming hordes of day trippers left the place was eerie, nearly all shops and restaurants shut and no-one around. Hotels don?셳 have lobbies (other than the Cafe de Paris) and so it?셲 like a ghost town. I only realised there were other guests when we arrived at breakfast and found hundreds clamouring for as much as they could eat! Look at pics-odd but strangely charming in a way. When we were there they were building a castle and a chateau-cant believe there are enough guests to pay for it. Feels like Putin?셲 secret pet project Gardens nice, views towards coast at Danang and Laos nice too. Supper interesting-serenaded by 2 bizarre musicians on the accordion and tambourine They do pool cinema which is a laugh but cold water for 2h and all the lockers and signs handmade/painted-just feels naff Some of the staff were really lovely tho, especially 2 girls from France on grad training in hospitality Overall worth seeing the bridge, but for $500????",
?곸뼱,Aug-19,2,"A Surreal and Bizarre Experience We should have done our homework better which is why I can?셳, in good conscience, give it only 1 star. We were under the impression this was a cable car style trip to a serene mountain top spot with temples and views. Partly true. As stated in numerous reviews, the cable car ride up is a real plus and the Golden Bridge is worth seeing. However, there are other things going on are incongruous with the natural beauty and setting - mainly the existence of a Frankenstein-esque Disney experience with all the bad bits spliced together alongside some, quite frankly, baffling elements. This creates a day out like no other. Sunworld at Ba Na doesn?셳 seem to know what it is. It?셲 a collage of cultural references and theme park cliches that just do not work together and hence you find yourself wandering about trying to make sense of just what the hell is going on. French chateau architecture with roman statues, German oompah bands, pagodas, medieval kings and queens, roller blading dancers, etc... it?셲 just plain weird. But hey, judging by the coach loads of tour groups pouring into the place, there are clearly those that love it. Unfortunately most have a selfie obsession which just adds a layer of frustration to the bizarreness. Wasn?셳 for me. Or my family. Or the other family we were with. Advice? Give it a good long look before committing a full day and $200 of your itinerary to be sure it ticks the right boxes.",
?곸뼱,Aug-19,1,"Awful, tacky, fake and crowded Terrible, crowded theme park. I thought there would be some part of it which was actually French and built in 1919 but if there is it's well hidden. It's all just fake. Speakers blasting out really loud music constantly and crowds everywhere. However, staggeringly beautiful mountain views from up there and the cooler temperature was enjoyable. Wouldn't go again and wouldn't recommend anyone else to go.",
?곸뼱,Aug-19,1,"Completely weird So I booked a tour - at vast expense - to take me up to the Golden Hands Bridge. The ticket to enter ? unworld??where the Bridge is was 750000 dong - 짙28! Seeing as the ticket was so expensive I strongly suggest this place invests in some serious crowd control. On the Bridge there must have been over 1000 people. At certain points I physically could not move let alone take any decent photos. The ticket to the Bridge also allows you to explore Sunworld and other destinations in the Ba Na Hills. Honestly the entire place was completely random! It was a strange amalgamation of breathtaking architecture, a theme park and a religious centre. I found myself bored and confused in the hills. If you?셱e looking for a cultural experience- as I was - I just wouldn?셳 bother the expense. Of course you can just go to see the Bridge but it?셲 such a massive hassle that I wouldn?셳 bother. I won?셳 be going back.",
?곸뼱,Aug-19,1,"Wasp infested waste of time I recommend you to avoid visiting this place, unless you enjoy swarms of wasps and overcrowding with selfie obsessed people.  I did not review Ba Na Hills properly (my own fault).  The main attraction for me was the Golden Bridge- which was nice, but the overcrowding and large wasps took away from it for me - it was difficult to escape from them (?맃) due to the crowds.  The cable car was a good experience.",
?곸뼱,Aug-19,1,Not worth the money Went here expecting it to be amazing what a disappointment it was it was very expensive for what it was the day did not start off well when we were charged 750000d per person to get in then when we get on the cable car it was with 5 members of staff who constantly looked us up and down talked about us and made us feel uncomfortable plus they never shut up so the whole cable car ride there was ruined as we just wanted to experience the journey a bit more peacefully then when we eventually get to the top the bridge was underwhelming as was the rest of the park nothing opened until 9pm when it did we wasn?셳 impressed with the overpriced goods and food would never recommend to anyone as we already told several couples that were going to go that it wasn?셳 worth the money so they decided not to visit was there a total of 4 hours which we will never get back,
?곸뼱,Jul-19,1,Not a great visit We visited bah nah hills in July The cable car ?슑 ride ... fantastic The French village architecture... fabulous As for the rest .. food .. restaurants.. service absolutely shocking ... was like stepping of the cable car to French Disneyland plastic city The hotel was average service terrible The restaurants were like being herded into a sheep station .. food absolutely shocking No lovely wee bars or cute little cafes Not at all Vietnam ?눤?눛 Would never go back very disappointed ?삛 People absolutely everywhere taking selfies Shops were a joke !!! Not going again,

First, there was no proper queue while waiting for the shuttle bus to bring you to the entrance. So when the bus arrived, everyone just squeezed into the bus. Fortunately, very short distance.  Signs were very visible to the cable car. Crowded, waiting time so pretty fast. Again, the staff on duty at the station would squeezed abt 8 people per cable car, hence I find it rather uncomfortable.  Actually, my main focus is the Golden Bridge and not the rest. So, once we reached the Golden Bridge, people everywhere, really crowded, hard to walk, and to stop to take pictures. In fact, everywhere was crowded.  This is the first time I was really pissed off with their local people. Not only the adults, and the children too, keep pushing us, touched our hands. Seriously, my friend and myself felt that they are so irritating.  It really dampen our mood. Actually, it still depend what is your intention to go there. For me, Golden Bridge only. End the trip, I wouldn't recommend.",
?곸뼱,Aug-19,1,"Ba Na hills Terrible the only good thing was the cable car. The French village with Roman soldier. statues. The number of ??selfies? eing taken is ridiculous you are stopped from walking so they take group photos, asked to move so a special can be taken, pushed out of the way so groups can pass . Don?셳 waste your $50 bucks . The Toboggan ride up to 1 hr wait standing in cold wind tunnel. Typical Asian show ritz and glitz but zero content.",
?곸뼱,Aug-19,1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY GOING HERE!!!! The only good thing about this place is the ride on the cable car! The golden bridge is much smaller than it looks, it?셲 been photographed very well on instagram to make it look good! It?셲 a pointless bridge, right next to the cable car so photos don?셳 even look that good! The whole place is heaving with Asian tourists taking selfies ( thousands of them!!!) , but to be honest that?셲 all there is to do there. We were there for 1 hour and that included the 20 minute cable car ride!!!!! If you have money to throw away then go there but if not PLEASE DONT WATSE YOUR TIME! We read reviews like this and thought people were just being fussy but they were right and we should have listened to them. We could have had 2 luxury spa treatments for the cost of visiting this place.",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,"Do your homework first This is an interesting place, but read peoples reviews first. The cable car and the new village construction are amazing, and worth a visit, but the actual experience is all about mass tourism spending. We stayed overnight, as a European traveller I would not recommend it. Once they get you here there is no care or attention, it is mass food hall dining - breakfast was worse than an army mess hall. My advice, get a reliable private driver, visit mid-afternoon, then leave about 8.00pm, the cable cars go until 10. Good luck",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,Stunning but very overcrowded It?셲 a beautiful environment and experience. However it was completely overcrowded and destroyed the experience for us.,
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,"For the most instagrammed place in Vietnam- it?셲 very overrated The Golden Bridge - you know the one - two big stone looking hands holding a bridge up. Comes up great in a photo but good luck getting a decent shot with so many people around. Recommend getting in as soon as it opens for some nice insta worthy shots. Saying that though, the bridge is a little over rated. So, starting from scratch, you need to pay to get into a theme park called Sun World. They are trying really hard to be like a Disneyland or Universal Studios - but so off the mark. It was about $30 US p/p for entry and this price is worth it only for the views. There are some amazing spots with views of Da nang that are awe inspiring. Some of the best coming from the canap챕 carts. If it wasn?셳 for this, I wouldn?셳 recommend going. Really, it is only worth going for the views. Nothing else really rates a mention. Sure there are some nice gardens and stuff but, meh.  The food was terrible. Even for them park food. We had hotdogs and they were disappointing.  Sadly, even the Starbucks there - which is normally very consistent around the world - did not hit the mark.  It?셲 all about the views!",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,"Cable car was the best Travelled from Hoi An for a day trip with family. Confused to why there are endless (never ending) corridors to get to the actual cable car entry.It was beautifully landscaped with greenery everywhere however. But it took so long just to get on the cable cars. Be prepared to queue! The scenery up the hill on the cable car was beautiful. Then you got to the top and were swamped by tourists! Expect tourists taking selfies everywhere you walk. The Map of the venue (essential to finding your way around) was in Vietnamese only! When you are hot and bothered and surrounded by people this doesn?셳 help. Enjoyed the Golden bridge and the views were great from everywhere - however very crowded. In the middle of the bridge a couple was ?쏿ttempting??to take wedding photos and trying to ward off the crowd (unsuccessfully) to take the perfect picture! What were they thinking!! Felt a bit trapped as we took the cable car down half way only to be told we can?셳 catch it back to the park entry. Had to go up again and then find our way to another departure point (hard when nothing on the map is in English) then exit. Would only recommend this place if you are ok with crowds of people and are very patient! Make sure you have plenty of time, as this place is huge.",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,"Better things to see in Danang We expected so much more than there actually was to see. The place is overcrowded, with lots of pushing and squashing throughout the bridge, the ride with a cable car is expensive. Overall not a great experience for us.",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,"Medieval European theme park in Vietnam Very big Medieval European theme park on top of beautiful scenery Ba Na hills. As a European I found this a big waste of my time, I would very much prefer to spend it experiencing the authentic beauty of the Vietnamese nature and culture instead.",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,1,Waste of time It's just a fake Vegas style tourist trap. The reality is so very different to those Instagram images! Be prepared for huge crowds and plastic scenery. No views with noting... in fact the only excitement was the cable car temporarily breaking down in mid- journey. Save your time and money and go to the city or beach. Total waste.,
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,"View was spectacular. French theme park unimpressive Cable car ride up the hill was amazing, some great views of nature and da nang city. Golden hands bridge is a little over rated. Super packed. The French village theme park was an utter waste of time. If possible look got a tour that spends minimal time there.",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,1,"Farcical / depressing This is meant to be a natural park - however rather than preserve nature and promote eco-tourism, it has been turned into an obscene, almost Kafkian-nightmare type of place.  Essentially it?셲 a weird recreation of an ancient French village (why anyone would want to experience this on a hill in Vietnam, god knows).  The scale of coaches turning up with hoards of tourists all following someone with a flag, pushing/shoving/shouting and obsessing over selfies, is phenomenal.  Expensive by Vietnam?셲 standards (750000 VND) (turn up after 4pm for discount).  The cable car ride is beautiful though and the bridge is very pretty - we were fortunate to experience this not too busy.  You get a buffet dinner included, which is in some weird beer keg shaped shiny construction in which you take an escalator down and like ants, fight for your rice with possessed Chinese tourists. Overall such a farcical experience. And to think it?셲 surrounded by such beautiful nature, which has been trashed by multi-national corporations who play on mass-tourism of people who don?셳 know their gluteus from their proximal radio-ulnar joint.",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,"Cable car trip was the best bit Its really crowded and a tourist rap. The cable car gives great views of Danang and surrounds, as does the view from the Golden Bridge. The rest is either faded glory or modern theme kitsch. It's super crowded and not cheap. They also randomly closed the main cable car route between 12 noon and 2 pm and so we got get stuck there trying to find and then get down through one of the smaller cable routes elsewhere in the park.",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,The security should be considered Please stay alert with our security system from tourists. It was super crowded and I think about the security. Every one can go in just with the tickets. No security check at all. It will be a disaster if some bad guys do something wrong for the place. Please think about that! Thanks!,
?곸뼱,Jul-19,1,"waiting...... this tourist attraction is very disorganised with simply hours upon hours of waiting in queues. Once you arrive at the top of the cable car route at the village, it is just a relief to be out of the crowds of thousands of other people. The facilities at the top are fine but I'm wondering what the fuss was about? This was not worth the effort or the ticket price.",
?곸뼱,Jul-19,2,"Highly tourstic We drove up a from Hoian by van (realtvly cheap, booked through our hostel hoa bihn, but still pricy) to the location based on recomandations from the web. Entrence fee was quite expensive in comparison to other sites and attractions in Vietnam. The attraction is highly tourstic, despite the amazing view, everything is man-maid on the mountain itself, very ""instegram oriented"", although the golden bridge itself is impressive in structure. The fantasy park is sutable for little kids and not very excaiting for teens/adult. Everything is pricy in the food departmant althoug very diverse. We were disapointed because the attraction isn't what we expected, and was too touristic.",
?곸뼱,Jun-19,2,"Great cable care ride If you don't like crowds then don't go. The cable care ride up was the only thing worth while. We did want to see the Golden Bridge which was impossible to enjoy due to the amount of people who were only there for the photo op. This rest was just ok. A few nice gardens and a view and that was about it. We allowed 3 hours, as advised by the hotel tour desk, but we had had enough after about 1 1/2 hours.",
?곸뼱,Jun-19,1,Cable car ride is only good thing The ride to the top and back is this only good thing about this place. The rest is ridiculous nonsense.,
?곸뼱,Jun-19,2,"Think twice before you go It was a horrible experience in the Ba Na Hills. Overcrowded with many tour groups (looks like local or SE Asia). Everywhere people were pushing and knew nothing about politeness. Felt like running away from zombies or crossing some kind of obstacle race. The only comfortable moment is when you get high up in the cable car, the wind becomes stronger and cools us down a lot. Restaurant is another joke. The price of buffets is not worthy for that quality of food. When we finished lunch, leaving the restaurant, again blocked by a huge group of visitors, you have to fight to get out. Overall I would say think twice before you go.",
?곸뼱,Jun-19,2,"Ba Na Hills - Not worth it Incredibly overcrowded with large numbers of tourists. They didn?셳 really care about shoving young children out of the way on the Golden Bridge. Same when we were headed back to the cable car station to get out of Bana Hills. Simply no queue system or crowd management.  There was a brief complete blackout at the amusement park where the rides were and that was somewhat concerning. The lights came on but a few minutes after, all the arcade machines were down but to their benefit, this took about 10 minutes to fix. The second time the machines were down, we gave up.  We had lunch at the restaurant at the Mercury Hotel and food was bad. i thought something like a beef burger should be a safe option but I was wrong. Overcooked and crumbly beef patty. Other dishes ordered were also subpar.  The only lovely thing was the cable car ride. Other than that, simply not worth it.",
?곸뼱,Jun-19,1,"Warning for Europeans: don?셳 go Ba Na Hills is nothing more than a touristic build up in the hills, made for Asian people (mainly South Koreans) to take selfies. The copycat buildings of French architectural highlights are a pain for the eye. I didn?셳 do enough research to find out (my fault) but please be warned. (I am Dutch)",
?곸뼱,Jun-19,2,Disappointing for the price SO overcrowded honestly couldn?셳 believe how many tickets they must sell! Very pricey for what it is - would have been more enjoyable if there wasn?셳 so many people couldn?셳 move anywhere. The que for the cable car back down to the station was ridiculous little kid nearly got trampled. The bridge was beautiful but for the price and the fact it was too busy let it down massively really should only allow so many people up there at a certain time,
?곸뼱,Jun-19,2,"Disappointing Do get tickets in advance as we did other wise we would?셶e spent easily up to an hour queuing. We got there at 9am by Grab Car and wished we?셝 got there for opening at 730am. It was rammed and it took us an hour of queuing before we got on the cable car. The cable car views were fantastic. The French village and theme park were not to our taste and was tacky, extremely loud music etc coming through speakers and awful. Huge groups of tours that had no regard for anyone else?셲 personal space, queuing etiquette and much much more besides. Headed to the golden hands bridge which was our reason for going, the bridge was fantastic and very busy as to be expected. From there we did the Alpine coaster ride which was good fun and then we made for the cable cars to get out of there. Glad we arranged trip ourselves as we could get out of there when we wanted. Very disappointed overall.",
?곸뼱,May-19,1,Terrible - a 'rip off'. Don't go! A tourist trap of the worst kind. Advertised as a French hilltop village - its fake! Fake buildings all housing overpriced cafes with awful food. I'd say it was a theme/amusement park except there's simply nothing to do there.  Swarms of tour groups. Best to be avoided.,
?곸뼱,Jun-19,1,"Overpriced, overcrowded, overrated and over a barrel. We went with 2 kids 6&8. Worst experience in any country ever. Tens of thousands of people there, we spent approx 4 hours in queues, could not get to see or play anything. Could not wait to get home, each hour was excruciating. Was on Saturday. Avoid at weekends, and during the week.",
?곸뼱,Jun-19,1,To be avoided Just back from a terrible day in Bana Hills. Wish we did not go with our kids. Hours queuing to cable car hours queuing to rides and gave up. Approx 7000 people per hour use cable car. First bad day in Vietnam. Cable car view and buffet were good. Had to push way through golden bridge. No time to take photos as I had to hold onto kids. Tour guide Jesmine from Venus travels was fantastic. DO NOT waste a day and money on Bana Hills. Awful++++,
?곸뼱,Oct-18,2,"tourist trap Most tourist come here for the golden bridge. It's better to infor in ahead, because it's high up in the montains and on cloudy days (even on sunny days too) it can be too cloudy to see the bridge! Which is a pity. Vietnames come here for a day out, because it's more like an attraction park, it's too expensive for what it! and not worth the money.",
?곸뼱,May-19,1,Disorganised Vietsheen Travel Tour Ba Na Hills was great and the food good. Cable car ride was fantastic and although very busy it was worth the wait to get on a couple of the rides/items in the fantasy park. But the tour we had picked was not good. The bus was 45 minutes late for pick up the bus was full of locals. The guide put all his attention into them spoke poor English and kept us waiting for all the other families to get to the meeting points. There was no mention of a stop at a shop for the locals on the way back to our hotel. All this made for a frustrating and annoying tour where we felt we were just being ignored and that we were not important enough to be shown more respect as overseas tourists. We would not treat people like this in our country. Do your research we wish we had gone on our own.,
?곸뼱,Apr-19,1,"If you like kitch, this is your place Went there for the golden bridge but you need to get the whole attraction deal. The nice part was the cable car which is the longest in the world (it's Swiss-made!). Apart from the bridge which is itself overcrowded, the rest of the park is strange... they have a medieval European town with real European comedians around (a bit like in a zoo in fact). Everything is fake and food is expensive). There is one ride for which you have to queue 2-3 hours... done it, no need to ga back",
?곸뼱,May-19,2,"not worth it, big disappointment Even though we came here very early (8am), the entire place and especially the Golden Bridge were already overcrowded. It was almost impossible to cross the bridge without getting hit by an umbrella or getting elbowed in the face.  With Ba Na Hills they tried to create a special place but they just built a bad copy of Disney Land. Everything seems so artificial, especially the Golden Bridge.  The Golden Bridge is a fat cash cow and they won?셳 hesitate to milk it to the last drop. Due to this the entry price is really expensive and not worth it, especially because you have to pay extra for attractions like the Madame Tussauds.  Vietnam has lots of things to offer but Bana Hills isn?쁳 it. You?쁫l have a better time at your local fair.",
?곸뼱,May-19,1,clouds a kind of disney parc. not very impressive and thousands of chinese people just following their leader,
?곸뼱,Nov-18,2,"Too crowded I went there twice, every time I found it too crowded. Do not take the buffet if u want to end up giving up and ate something else like me =))",
?곸뼱,May-19,2,Cool place to visit - but not if your handicap. I visited the property on a knee scooter. Omg what a challenge. I don?셳 think Asia give a crap if you have any sort of disability. Good luck navigating this property. I only give it two stars as it was super difficult to tour the property on crutches or a knee scooter even. So many stair and steep steps. Lack of elevators or assistance at all. It was a cool place to visit if your fully capable of walking and climbing steps and steep walkways.,
?곸뼱,May-19,2,"Crowded on holiday weekend This place is unique and could have been a better experience if we didn?셳 visit on a holiday weekend in Vietnam.  It was incredibly crowded and felt like going to Disney. The lines were generally lengthy and it was impossible to get interesting pictures of most things because of the insane crowds.  If you?셶e got nothing else to do in the area (which is hard to believe) it might be worth a visit, but do it on an uncrowded day and get there early! Also, perhaps worth spending a night up top to benefit from smaller crowds and a more unique experience.",
?곸뼱,Apr-19,1,So poor managment and security staff We went to Bana Hill with guests as we do may times in the past. When we arrive at the parking lot the security guard fight with our driver in front of our guests and other guests for unknown reasons.. I write an official complain to the management and after one week and 2 reminder no answer. Our driver when to hospital for Xray and receive 2 days off after the fight with security guard. That is not acceptable in a touristic destination and that more unacceptable from the management to be so impolite and not answer to the official complaint From Now on we stip to sendd and put on black list this poor destination .,
?곸뼱,Apr-19,1,"Don't Go We were there to see the Golden Bridge and we didn't know this place is an Asian version of Disneyland. When we got there, they asked admission fees for about $170 in CASH! We needed to keep the cash for the driver, so asked to use credit card but he insisted NO CREDIT CARD. Meanwhile, there was a mom and a daughter next me using her credit card (!!) to pay her admission fees! I told my guy that why can't I use credit card and okay for her but he didn't speak English and kept telling me to pay in cash, so I left the park! This place is a SCAM and please DO NOT GO!!!",
?곸뼱,Apr-19,1,"French themed theme park overrun with swarming tourists There were coach-load and coach-loads of tourists who are dumped to this place as part of their package tours; so the huge place was completely swamped by people.  All the queue-jumping, jostling, shouting tourists as well as the heat ruined the visit. We escaped our tour half way..  The cable-car system is really fantastic, the french themed buildings make for an interesting atmosphere and the staff are good. Many more facilities are under construction at the top of the hill, so I guess it will get better..  We went to the buffet lunch - it was a big spread, but the quality was mediocre. (Did I mention the jostling crowd?)  The live entertainment was good, both in the French village and in the Fantasy Park where they have rolling continuous shows on stages. The Fantasy Park is mainly just rows of arcade machines - not impressed..  I didn?셳 go on the Alpine coaster. This is one of the main attractions - but the queue for it was going to be a whole-day affair at this stage.  Finally, the Golden Bridge: Not as big as it looks on photos and the ?쐆ands??appear to be painted concrete.. for us; it was completely overrun, so it was basically one block of people attempting desperately trying to take selfies.",
?곸뼱,Apr-19,1,Only for those obsessed with selfies This experience was horrible and expensive. The only reason to go is if you love taking photos of yourself. It was absolutely packed when we went. Other than a building full of video games there isn?셳 much of interest. Any chance of pretending you are in a French village is taken away by the thousands of people.,
?곸뼱,Apr-19,2,"Just not my thing We were attracted by the Golden Bridge, but ended up at a modern amusement park. I guess it would be ok for younger adults and families and amusement parks are my thing. The tour package doesn't allow for much time and the park was crowded, so you really couldn't do much. You get picked up around 8 but you go to other hotels to get others. And it takes almost an hour to get to Bana Hills. So with the gondola ride up the mountain, the walks to the gardens, buddha, Golden bridge, another gondola ride to the top where the amusement area is and lunch is provided. You end up with at the most 2 hours for the park, before you have to leave at 3:30 to return to your hotel. For me it wasn't worth it. But the Golden bridge was nice and the gondola rides were scenic.",
?곸뼱,Apr-19,1,Do not waist your time This place is a pure tourist trap and not worth the time. The cable car ride was good but the park is typical Viet Nam garbage. The bridge is an interesting work of art and the view was spectacular but that's it. Over crowded and the food is crap and expensive. Spend the day on the beach and enjoy your time there. Skip this place save your money and enjoy something else.,
?곸뼱,Apr-19,2,"Bring your ear plugs... this place is a building site Ba Na hills started off very badly and continued to get worse. Where do I start. We had 2 nights booked. We arrived at the reception after being picked up from the beautiful Hoi an. Reception told us that our booking had be cancelled. X number 1  We get to the gondola which is pretty amazing, built 9 years ago. There is 4 of them that seems a little over kill.. or not!! We get to the top of the mountain to find 5000 people downloading. What have we done.  We are taken to our room through the sea of people. We checked into our room which are park of the castle. Rooms are nice but not overwhelming.  We head out for something to eat as it has taken a few hours to get everything sorted. Nothing was open, this was unexceptable. I have 3 teenage kids and no food. We had to wait another hour and a half before anything opened for dinner. We ate at the beer hall. It was terrible but we would of eaten cardboard.  X number 2  I guess they?셱e trying to make BaNa hills feel like a mini Disneyland in the mountains of Vietnam. The temperature is 12 degrees less then the valley, so it?셲 nice and mild. Unfortunately after you fight with the 1000s of day trippers to go on a ride the day is over pretty quick. Once the day trippers leave you are once again waiting for the evening restaurants to open. We thought we would try the Tapas restaurant. During the day all you?셪l hear is tile cutters, carts along the pavers and jackhammers. You would hope they would stop at night but this is Vietnam, and they build all night. Which is fine but when you can?셳 escape the noise it?셲 draining. The restaurant had to play the music so load to drain out the noise of the tile cutter. We couldn?셳 here ourselves talk. On the request to have the music turned down the waitress said they had to keep it load so the people outside the restaurant would hear it as they walk past. Huh.  X number 3  So, is there anything good here. The view is amazing but, you?셪l be very lucky to get a clear day. The gardens and temples are beautiful and well looked after.  The hand bridge is cool but once again, just too many people .  Would I recommend this place, Yes but only do one night max and pack your earplugs?ㄻ  Three strikes I?셫 out..",
?곸뼱,Apr-19,2,"Don't bother The cable car is great and a genuine unique experience - that's the good news. The French Village is an utter joke, the only real French bit appears to be lost in a sea of fake/pretend buildings straight out of Universal Studios theme park. It really seems that someone went to Universal in Orlando and thought 'this would be great up a mountain in Vietnam'. I expected to see Mickey bloody Mouse appear at one point in a parade, then out of nowhere came a sodding brass band playing random pop tunes! The queue for the outdoor rollercoaster took an hour and my word a white knuckle ride it is not! Thankfully the indoor stuff is rather better. The Golden Bridge itself is a good idea but you need to elbow your way past all the over excited, self obsessed, selfie stick wielding morons to even get a chance at a look/photo. If it was marketed as a cable car trip up a mountain and back with stuff to do at the top it would be more appropriate - you have been warned.",
?곸뼱,Apr-19,1,"Don't even bother The only thing this place has got going for it is the cable car ride up and back. As for everything else, just forget it. Its a theme park built around supposed French castles and cobbled streets. Many are still under construction but there finish dates is anybody's guess. Some of the gardens are quite nice but will take more time to establish as I believe the whole park has only existed for around 5 years or so. The walk itself around the park is an absolute nightmare with thousands of tourists jockeying for their position with their bloody camera sticks or their random photo's of anything that moves. The worst of this nightmare is on the 'Golden Bridge"" where it is almost impossible to make your way from one way to the other. You are better off lying on a beach somewhere or propping up a bar rather than wasting a day at this place.",
?곸뼱,Apr-19,1,"PLEASE DO NOT GO I just wasted an entire day, which I will never get it back. I do not understand what the hype is about this park, which should be an insult to all Europeans. Everything about this ?쐔heme park??is artificial, and so fake that should insult one?셲 intelligence. There is zero cultural experience. It is a tourist trap with fake infrastructure, bad and overpriced food, and extremely crowded.  Please spend your time and money elsewhere such as Hoi An and Marble Mountains.",
?곸뼱,Apr-19,2,"Meh To be fair, I didn?셳 do the amusement park. We went at opening to visit the Golden Hand bridge- it is definitely beautiful but if you don?셳 get there at opening it becomes EXTREMELY crowded. Since we went at opening (0700)- none of the rides or restaurants were opened. By the time we left (0930) the place was swarming with people. It?셲 a $33 admission fee basically for a photo op and a pretty cool cable car ride up!",
?곸뼱,Mar-19,2,"Waste of time and money We went there with quite low expectations but at the end we were still quite disappointed.  Good things: The cable car ride is actually pretty impressive, the view is really nice. We went directly to the Golden Hands bridge which we thought is going to be really crowded but it wasn?셳 that bad after all (it was around 1pm) and the view was super nice.  After that the whole park was a complete disaster. If you have ever been to France than you can tell how extremely far from a French village it is. It looks like they were trying to make it as fake as possible with the cheap painting walls and other stuff. For an amusement park there is absolutely nothing to do, some activities (like the wax museum) even require extra entrance which i think it?셲 stupid since the whole entrance is pretty expensive. And the waiting lines are crazy long, waiting for more than an hour for a short slide just doesn?셳 make sense. A lot of things are still under construction and it looks more like a mix of a child?셲 room and a construction site overcrowded with tourist taking selfies everywhere.  Spare yourself the time and money and do something else.",
?곸뼱,Mar-19,1,"Don?셳 waste your time and money Wow. Complete waste of time and money. I was so excited to visit Ba Na Hills, particularly the Golden Bridge which always seemed so serene in photos. The whole attraction is completely overrun with tourists. It is impossible to take a photo or move for that matter without someone in your personal space. The French Village is a joke, completely fake and gaudy. Children over 100cms are charged a fee however most rides have a minimum height requirement of 120cm. Please don?셳 waste your precious time in such a beautiful country at a disgustingly touristy money trap. It?셲 a disgrace to Vietnam.",
?곸뼱,Mar-19,1,"Schlock fest Stupid artificial and overrun by tourists, completely fake, makes Disney world look like Mother Nature. Avoid this waste of time and money. Cheesy restaurants serving lowest quality food",
?곸뼱,Mar-19,2,"Yikes - beware! We went to Ba Na Hills for the Golden Bridge and the views. First mistake - DO NOT go on a bad weather day. It's simply pointless and a waste of money.  But, that's not why the two stars. Put simply, we weren't expecting it to be one of the naffest places on earth. Seriously, we were in hysterics at how awful it is at the so-called 'French village'. It's shockingly naff - I mean, shockingly. I would hate it if anyone I'm close to thinks it's nice. It's horrific.  The gardens and all that a level below are pleasant, but you'll (hopefully) want to get out of the 'French village' as soon as you possibly can.  Yikes!",
?곸뼱,Mar-19,2,No to go on a cloudy day When cloudy you shouldn't be there because there won't be any views. Cable car ride is about the only excitment from this visit. An attraction you only go once. Food outlets are pathetic.,
?곸뼱,Mar-19,1,"Ba Na Hills and the Golden (Hand) Bridge Overpriced (with the ticket for the cable car alone being 700,000) feels very fake, very touristy. Very little feels or looks authentic. There are several hotels at the top. Why on earth you would want to stay at the top of these hills I have no idea, there is nothing to do.",
?곸뼱,Mar-19,1,"Not worth your time or money I had seen pictures of the Golden hands bridge prior to coming to Vietnam and definitely wanted to add it to my list. However, after paying 700,000VND to gain entry into the park I was really disappointed. Every tourist attraction (especially the golden hands bridge) was extremely packed with people to the point where everyone was pushing and it was impossible to take a photo without other people in it. Once I got to the French Village I saw that half of it was under construction which looked ugly, was noisy, and dusty. They had a show put on by park employees which was essentially just a bunch of white backpackers dancing around in costumes. The food was overpriced and poor quality (90,000VND for a hotdog). The Ba Na hills surrounding the park are absolutely stunning and it's a shame that they have created this massive park which is not a true reflection of the beauty of this area. I asked my shuttle service if I could return to Da Nang 4 hours early because I didn't want to spend any time or money in countless tacky souvenir shops. Maybe if you are travelling with young kids and want a more ""westernized"" experience in Vietnam than this park is for you. I honestly would not recommend anyone to come to this attraction otherwise.",
?곸뼱,Mar-19,1,"Dont get off the cable car Fabulous engineering and great views from the cable cars. The rest of it is tacky, loud and, even on a not busy day, crowded. The Golden Bridge is not a bridge just a photo opportunity. The food and drink outlets are hugely overpriced and even more dissapointing, in a country that is the largest exportor of coffee in the world, the coffee (bilge water) we were served was undrinkable. It was also strange to see a Starbucks outlet at the top when Hoi An has probably the best coffee shop chain (Hoi An Roastery) in the whole of Asia.",
?곸뼱,Mar-19,2,"Disney World We were excited at the prospect of seeing Ba Na Hills from the famous cable car and seeing the Golden Hands Bridge. We booked a trip via the hotel which promised us just that and we?셝 be back at the hotel at 4pm. The actual trip had 35 people crammed in a tiny bus which stopped at a marble shop for 35 minutes which meant when we arrived at Ba Na Hills we were way behind the thousands of other tour groups. The cable car views were stunning, the bridge was as expected except I hadn?셳 realised that it was a fun park. We had to hang around for hours (apparently we could play games) until we finally departed but not before a compulsory visit to a supermarket. Dear God it was tedious. We complained to the tour guide but to no avail. Recommend that of theme parks aren?셳 your thing but stunning scenery is, then hire a driver to take you there - wait for 2/3 hours and drive you back.",
?곸뼱,Mar-19,1,It's kinda beautiful but I love amusementparks and don't care if it is crowdy or fake. What I do hate is that you pay the full price for a park that looks more like a construction yard then a french village. Almost all the buildings had scaffolding and beside that you are not allowed to go in anywhere it's only for hotel guests. It's like you pay money to see a hotel from the outside. The amusement park is nice but very outdated. I would not recommend it because of all the constructions and not lowering the price because of that.,
?곸뼱,Mar-19,1,"Don?셳 go to the buffet This buffet is amazing bad, how do you get your food so cold so quickly? The food is always being topped up but everything is luke warm. The only thing nice was the bread and butter. Oh and the lemon ice tea was decent. Do yourself a favour, have a really big breakfast before arriving. Then have dinner afterwards. The price is cheap but food poisoning would suck. I filled up on bread and butter so I should be safe.  Ba na Hills is pretty cool and worth the trip even though the buffet spoiled my day.",
?곸뼱,Jan-19,2,"Cable car journey was good On the plus side we enjoyed the cable car journey, however our view was obscured for the majority of the way by very thick mist and we didn't get to appreciate the views. Leaving the cable car we found a 'Disney' type theme park. We left early and we wouldn't go back.",
?곸뼱,Jan-19,1,"Kicked off Golden Bridge and left hanging in cable car The day started off really well, arriving at the gates just before 7am to no queues. We got to the famous Golden Bridge with few other people. It was lovely until 2 then 3 then 5 other brides and their photo crew turned up and were demanding we get off the bridge so they could take photos and videos. At first we waited, then it got ridiculous as more brides came and the photography crew got more rude and demanded we get off the bridge. This was very frustrating as we had paid to be there and made an effort to be early.  Moving on, the rest of the park gradually opened and was very well maintained. However we had seen what we wanted to so started to make our way back down the mountain via the cable car.  As the cable car that goes from the top to the bottom wasn?셳 t opened yet, the only open was to take 2 separate lines down. On the second one, we were about half way down when it suddenly stopped. Then after a minute or so it started reversing then completely stopped again! We were dangling in an extremely high section and the line went slack. We were bobbing up and down and flailing in the wind.  40 minutes passed and only by getting in touch with the park via Facebook messenger (with VERY slow replies to our requests for help eventhough they had seen our messages) did we eventually get let down.  They tried to say it was a change in electrical lines but it turns out they had turned it off completely as they didnt think anyone was on it!!! Well we were and it was a very scary experience. They had no idea we were in a cable car.  Do not get on the cable cars if you don?셳 see other people get on first. Also go ready with a Vietnamese phone number (with credit) and data in case of emergency.  If we didn't have the data who knows how long we would have been left dangling there in the sun, bobbing up and down in the wind on the slack line.",
?곸뼱,Feb-19,2,"Over commercialized Since the golden hand bridge went viral, my husband was so excited to visit Ba Na Hills. The bridge was cool but shorter than we expected and very pretentious (eg the moss is painted on)  The flower garden was beautiful and you can tell they spent a fortune building this place. However, the amusement park was very cheesy like a wannabe of C-rated Disney Land.  Since we weren?셳 interested in anything else than the golden hand bridge, $32 USD entrance fee per person is too steep. However if you plan to bring kids and spend a whole day there then it?셲 worth it. If you have a local ID then you get 50% off the entrance fee.",
?곸뼱,Feb-19,2,"The worst experience I have ever made in Vietnam I don?셳 mind to visit tourist attractions but Ba Na hills totally didn?셳 fit to my way of traveling. Many people love Ba Na hills but for me it was just kitschy and commercial spot for tourist. The view from the hills was really beautiful but especially French Village totally destroys such a beautiful place. Every restaurant and coffee place play laud and very commercial music, full of people with selfie sticks, there is a roller coaster, people with special costumes so all tourist can take a picture with them... and everything makes a weird, plastic, kitschy and bad vibe there. I was totally shocked coming from some worship place in one of the part of Ba Na hills to such a commercial kind of not fiting to surrounding spot. I spent 3 h siting close to one of the pagoda with the view of mountains ( which was the best part of my trip) You can barely walk through the Golden Bridge, you can forget to find a free spot to take a picture. It?셲 very weird atmosphere there, nobody cares if directly in front of your eyes someone takes pictures, or you will be accidentally on pictures of all Chinese family doesn?셳 matter if you want or no, no traveling culture there everyone push each other. Terrible. It?셲 waste of the time and money. It?셲 nothing natural there except the nature around, everything is made for tourists. If you like historical places, definitely don?셳 go there. I was regretting wasting my day. instead of it I would rather visit some temples or go to peninsula.",
?곸뼱,Feb-19,2,Strange Disneyland Asia not worth to visit The hills are nice to see but not for the price. The bridge is interesting but the park full of people. The amusement park is awful.,
?곸뼱,Feb-19,2,Theme park with no rides or sparkle Disney on a larger more saccarhine scale! The highlight was the Austrian cable car to the top of the hills 5 km through the tree tops - that developers want to de forest The whole thing at the top was awful - nothing of any substance The bridge is interesting but packed Selfie sticks dominant everybody?셲 activity.. French area was dreadful as was the mass catering of the beer cellar Glad to get out of the cable car - and back on the road to Danang A disappointing day,
?곸뼱,Feb-19,2,"Cheap looking theme park, nice bridge and gardens Not sure if this is worth the money, at least not for everyone. The theme park gives a very cheap impression. It immitates the European places and culture, such as church, Mouling Rouge, beer place... I heard it's very popular for locals and I don't wonder why. But I'm not local and I found it very cheap looking. Why I came to the place was the bridge hold by two hands. This I found interesting, especially at pictures. Reality: very crowded, we moved at the bridge as a herd of sheep and had hard time to take nice photos. Taking the price of entrance ticket into the consideration, I recommend you to go somewhere else.",
?곸뼱,Feb-19,2,Not worth the money. The golden bridge is amazing but is very very crowded. A million people trying to take selfies for Instagram. The cable car was also cool but the park itself was so random nothing made sense and was hard to figure out how to get to places. Not worth the money in my opinion I would consider doing something else instead of going to Ba Na Hills.,
?곸뼱,Jan-19,1,"Kavkaz restaurant - food poisoning This is applicable only to Kavkaz restaurant at Sunworld Ba Na hills  Can totally recommend lamb grill if you want to get a severe food poisoning. That was pretty much the only food I had that day (and grossly overpriced) so I'm quite sure Kavkaz is the source of my poisoning.  Have been throwing up for 2 hours, started to develop terrible fever and ended up in a hospital on IV 6 hours later. By the way plov has nothing do with the authentic one, they serve just rice and meat cooked separately.",
?곸뼱,Jan-19,1,"If you?셱e here just for the bridge, beware...Expensive tourist trap/theme park As per a previous review, my wife (being a landscape architect) was lured by the golden bridge. Also, as per the previous review, we didn?셳 do our research and didn?셳 realise that the bridge itself is set within a large theme park. It was very misty when we got to the top too so could barely see the bridge either. 짙25 each is definitely not worth it and, unless you?셱e into theme parks I really wouldn?셳 pay the money to come to just see the bridge. There are many more interesting attractions in this area that don?셳 involve this place. One tip; if you decide you want to come here solely for the bridge and, if the weather is iffy, BEFORE you pay for a ticket, just check the cctv cameras near the ticket office to see what the views are like up top. Something we?셝 have done if we?셝 realised. Sorry Ba Na - this has been Vietnam?셲 biggest disappointment so far...",
?곸뼱,Jan-19,1,"Waste of money and time We should have done our due diligence in researching this place before deciding to make the trek out from Hoi An. Admittedly my wife was lured in by the golden hands bridge, but we did not realize it was part of theme park. Silly us. We spent two hours here and that was just because we wanted to try not to waste the money we paid for a ticket. We paid 750,000 each to attend plus car trip. If you?셱e still vibing the idea of attending for the golden hands Instagram photo - then go for it just make sure you?셱e going on a clear day.  Positives: The cable car ride was the most interesting aspect of this day. If you?셱e prepared to part with more money, the arcade area seemed ok.  Negatives: X If the weather is not great the mountain is covered in fog. It also gets very cold. X this is a literal maze of fake unoccupied buildings, food halls and hotels with no attractions in between X the park was full of disrespectful tourists with no concern for anyone else. Be prepared for people to stop randomly in front of your for a selfie or to spit. X in a clearly marked occupied one cubicle toilet, a person broke down the door to get in to stand behind me while I went to the toilet. X the park is half finished in most areas  This is definitely a tourist trap, and an attraction we could have skipped on our trip. Don?셳 be like us, do your research before deciding to go.",
?곸뼱,Jan-19,2,"Complete tourist trap The golden bridge with the hands is cool, and the gondola is impressive, but this is all part of a completely touristy theme park. The theme you ask? Europe...I think? The architecture is chalet style made to look old, and the whole thing is just restaurants and gift shops. The beer hall was closed when we went, as was the garden - the two things that were of interest to us. Everything is also still under construction so the view is hampered by construction vehicles and dirt. The food isn?셳 good, and they were out of both the dish and the beer we first ordered at Le Brasserie (French name, Italian food). The signage is also pretty bad and they make it very difficult to get out. A complete waste of time and money.",
?곸뼱,Jan-19,2,"Very Crowded! We visited on a Saturday it was near impossible to find a place to sit and enjoy it. The Golden Bridge itself is amazing, but the rest of the place isn?셳 worth it. The buffet restaurant we ate at was so full we had to sit outside in the rain and the food was cold with poor selection. Maybe on a weekday it is less busy but other than the Golden Bridge it isn?셳 something I would recommend",
?곸뼱,Jan-19,1,Disappointed It is very expensive and also you pay for the amusement park more than for the bridge. They should have different types of ticket. I was only interested on the golden bridge.,
?곸뼱,Jan-19,2,"Meh We took an hour taxi from Hoi An to Ba Na Hills. It's not a cheap day out, as the tickets to go up were 700k VND each (30USD). We didn't see much on the cable car ride up because if the fog. The golden bridge wasn't anything spectacular and the various gardens weren't very interesting. Then again, this could just be my taste as a lot of other tourists were taking a lot of photos- even in the fog and donning the bright plastic ponchos that they give out for free.  We then took another cable car up to the French village. There was quite a lot of construction happening and certain areas of of bounds. It was quite weird to be honest. ""amusement centre"" was rubbish- rides were below average at best. The best part was that the arcade games were free to play. There's also a soft play area for kids. We had a small game of Pacman and watched others play a game that's similar to dance dance revolution that was popular back in the early 2000s. We didn't try the food there because it all looked the same. Only when we were leaving, we discovered that there are 5 cable cars. We had no idea. The signs aren't great and the map that you can get at the golden bridge is unhelpful. Honestly, it wasn't worth what we paid as the weather wasn't great and we couldn't enjoy the views. The cable car ride down had better views for us.",
?곸뼱,Dec-18,2,"Very underwhelming We took a taxi from Da Nang to Ba Na Hills (approx 40 mins).  The cable car was one of the better parts of the visit as the views are enjoyable, however once we broke through the clouds towards the top it was very misty and raining.  As it was misty on the day that we visited we weren't able to appreciate the view from the bridge - you could barely see from one hand to the other.  We wish that we'd gone straight back down after visiting the bridge, however we made the mistake of taking a second cable car to the French town. The town is a very weird place and feels very fake and manufactured. It's clearly a novelty for those tourists who haven't visited Europe before, however it's a very tacky place if you've experienced the real thing. We stopped for a bit of lunch but this was very tasteless.  Our return journey on the cable car was ruined by 4 or 5 young Vietnamese men who were very noisy the whole way down. We were surprised to see these men head for the staff exit at the bottom as you'd think that staff would be more considerate of other people.  All in all this attraction is overhyped and overpriced. It would be better if there was a cheaper ticket option that gave access to the cable car and bridge only for those wishing to avoid the French town.",
?곸뼱,Jan-19,1,expensive! ways to expensive for what you get. worth only for the view during the trip on the cable car. the rest is just a lunapark for unexperted tourists,
?곸뼱,Dec-18,1,"Too confusing a place to have fun Its raining day at Ba Na Hills. But even without the rain, this place is like a maze with so many cable cars stations but yet no clear sign of which station are we at. The map is also not helpful and there is not enough staff around. We went to the wine cellar but there was not much to see in there.  Its too big and too confusing a place to be in and have fun.",
?곸뼱,Dec-18,2,"Don't go in bad weather I start by saying we got terrible Weather and that did not help the overall experience.  But even trying to think about it in good weather I don't think I'd come again.  I came because of the bridge. And in bad weather, forget it. This is a mountain weather and rain here means fog, so you really don't see anything. Then, for the price and considering it takes a full day from your trip.... What else you have here? Disneyland. A fake French village, with the fake fake and fake feeling all fake Things have. Wotj the annoying tinini music from speakers and all. Carrossel type entertainment but all inside in a ""cave"", no natural light. Really, I think this is a park for vietnamita people - to see a French village and a Disneyland low standard. Not for Foreigners.  Appart from That, construction works everywhere.  So if you are passing by the cable car (when there is a view) is amazing and the bridge will also be. But only if you are on the way to Somewhere. Don't by a full day tour. And again, don't come without sun.",
?곸뼱,Dec-18,1,"Do not bother It was raining all day and wet while we were here. A typical theme park where you spend most of your time just queuing with the crowds. Due to the weather, the cable cars fogged up and there?셲 nothing much to see. A pity as the theme park is beautiful but the weather made it impossible to enjoy.  Also, signages were poor. We could not figure out which stations the cable cars were going to, it?셲 just a whole big maze. Save your money and go to a spa in Da Nang instead.",
?곸뼱,Dec-18,2,Tourist attraction Overrated. Yes the view is nice if you are lucky with the weather. The rest of the fantasyland look like a fake replica or copy paste of Disneyland.  If you are a big group it?셲 not worth the money. Go and spend it somewhere else!,
?곸뼱,Dec-18,1,"Do not visit during wet season or on a rainy day WARNING: Don't visit this place during the wet season or on a rainy day. Because no one at the front door is going to tell you that you'll be greatly disappointed when you got up there.  I was attracted to visit this place after seeing the photos others have taken. Thinking this place is very picturesque despite the fact that it is entirely man-made. We went there during the wet season when it was not raining in town.  When I arrived the hall at the bottom of the hill, I already had the impression that the place was lack of maintenance as the ponds which were supposed to be filled with water, were all empty. Nonetheless we got onto one of the cable cars, as it began to climb up I did enjoy the view for a bit until all of a sudden, we found that we were surrounded by fog with zero visibility. The cable car ride was long and in fact the foggy situation made me a little sick.  When we arrived at the top, yes, of course the fog remained, and that was literally what we saw for the entire tour of the site, fog! Foggy and wet wherever we walked. Visibility was so poor that we could merely see anything. The site looked nothing like it was advertised. There were no staffs around except at the few food stalls. The place was so lack of maintenance that it looked like an abandoned city in a horror movie.  The way to all the locations were also very confusing, there were no guides or instructions to help us. And we thought we missed out some locations (i.e. the church, castle...) We did not know how to get there.  It would be a nice attraction on a fine day. On a rainy day, please avoid it at all cost. In my opinion, this place should not be opened to public at all when the weather makes it worthless for a visit.",
?곸뼱,Dec-18,1,"100% would not recommend We visited during the winter months - so can sympathise with the terrible visibility and risk of weather - but we were unaware that this meant half the park would be closed for construction work. It is advised that you allow for 5 hours to be spent at the attraction. However, for us, all the excitement had disappeared by the time we had reached the top of the second cable car and we ended up spending only a total of 2 hours here.  The first cable car takes you soaring up to the golden bridge. Unfortunately when we visited the weather was so poor and cloudy you couldn?셳 see one hand while standing looking from the other! The weather of course can not be blamed on the park but the lack of warning and poor amusements surely must be.  The second cable car takes you up to a village which I can only describe as pure Chinese tack. We had ear-marked several places we might be able to go for a coffee though a large section of the vendors had been closed off for building work and the only offerings for food and drink were overpriced junk.  We thought the trip could be salvaged by a visit to the French village and the wine cellar but discovered that the cable car down to the village was out of service. There was, though, another means to get there and we were left incredibly frustrated to finally find the wine cellar also closed!  We were so disappointed with the whole experience that we went to the customer service desk to complain. I understand that construction work and repairs are best completed during winter months but they should either lower the ticket price or provide a warning to make people aware that most places are closed. The director, who refused to provide us with his name, hid behind his two colleagues who, although sympathetic and helpful, were not able to authorise any form of refund or really acknowledge our complaints.  Such a terrible shame but have to say it wasn?셳 worth the money or time at all! Perhaps when the views are so spectacular from the Golden Bridge these complaints can be overlooked but I?셫 left bitterly disappointed at what could be such an incredible experience with a few touches of class and care.",
?곸뼱,Dec-18,2,Scam in bad weather We arrived without prebooking a ticket and was charged 1400000 vnd (about 50 quid for 2) to go up in the cable car and access to the park. Problem is it that it was cloudy so there were absolutely no views from within the cloud on the cable cars and the golden bridge. I know it's not their fault it was cloudy but they should tell you and should lower their prices. Especially when half of the park was closed. Ensure you go on a clear day otherwise it's not worth it.,
?곸뼱,Dec-18,1,Waste of money I was so disappointed in this place. The only reason I visited here was to see the golden bridge as I had seen so many amazing photographs of it. In real life it was really disappointing as it was much smaller than I expected l. Although I am even more disappointed that it is built within the Sunworld park. What a scam. To see the bridge I had to spend $60 AUD to go on a tour up the cable cars where we spent 1 hour at the bridge. After that we had lunch and another 3 hours at the theme park further up the cable cars. The cable cars were great but I didn?셳 need to see the ridiculous rides and everything else that went along with it. It is sad to see them destroying the natural environment to build these ugly monstrosities. The rivalry between the Vinpearl Land owner and the Sunworld owner needs to stop because both theme parks are as discounting as each other.,
?곸뼱,Dec-18,2,"Hands Overrated. You have to buy a ticket to the theme part SunWorld in order to go see the bridge. $700,000 dong to go up.",
?곸뼱,Dec-18,2,"Waste of a day We were really disappointed with our day at the BaNa Hills Sunworld. The bridge with the hands and the cable car are pretty cool, but the sunworld theme park is very strange. Our kids enjoyed the few rides that they have, but other than them, it is basically large video game arcade. They have bizarre shows performed by Europeans which are a bit creepy to be honest. These guys perform and then pose for photos with Asian tourists and then ask for tips. The Christmas shows were very over the top and made little sense in the context of Vietnam. Overall it was a waste of a day and a waste of money. If you do decide to go take food with you, the food is expensive as you would expect, but it is also pretty poor quality.",
?곸뼱,Nov-18,1,Disappointing - Tourist trap Would not recommend - very touristy - good if you have kids - very expensive food and drink once inside. It was raining the whole time we were there so no views which would have been the only thing to saved it for us.,
?곸뼱,Nov-18,1,A day out to see the bridge Massively overrated. The whole experience is crap.  Some people were working on the pavement in the France village and covered my girlfriend with mud. They couldn?셳 care less.  The gold bridge is really tacky. Please see my photo. The gold is actually coming off!,
?곸뼱,Nov-18,1,Don't go if you are European The bridge was crowded and it was the only worth it. The rest is pure crap. It's very expensive and in the end is like a theme park with few attractions.,
?곸뼱,Nov-18,2,"Disappointing Nothing special, a lot of tourists. Very expensive tickets. Many expensive restaurants. I would definitely not be back!",
?곸뼱,Nov-18,2,"been here before in the summer and enjoyed it We went to Ba Na hills, during the summer/spring months and completely enjoyed it. This time we went in the winter months and the top of the mountain was in the clouds, rainy, wet, crowds of people were still there but much of the attractions were either not there in the winter or dulled by the weather Don't get me wrong it's still an amazing place, I just don't think I'll be going there or Da Nang in the winter again. In the summer there are costumed performers roaming the park very carnival type atmosphere and as I said in the summer we were totally enchanted by the place..",
?곸뼱,Nov-18,2,Odd Place Strange to be visiting a Disneyland like European town in the mountains of Da Nang. The several cable cars to get up and down was the more interesting part of the trip. If you really must see a European make believe village then worht the visit.,
?곸뼱,Nov-18,1,Not worth a visit Too expensive and way to many tourists. Not authentic at all and just built for tourism. I would have expected more.,
?곸뼱,Nov-18,1,"Not worth the money Only thing that was nice was the bridge. Entrance was 1.400.000 dong for 2 persons, which was really to much (??3 when paying by creditcard)  The coolest things (wine cellar, beer plaza etc) were closed..  I can imagine it might be nice for non-europeans, but for us it was just fake and full of stereotypes.  We could have spend our day better, I would say: save your money for something else and avoid this place!",
?곸뼱,Nov-18,2,"Overpriced Tourist Trap Sun World's Bana hills is quite expensive and quite cheesy.  There is the cable car to the top (which is mandatory, hiking up is forbidden) and a fake french village like Disneyland.  The hand bridge has blown up on the internet, but in real life it's not as spectacular #filteredAF.  Just my two cents. If you're rich and Jane nothing else to do, I'd say go for it. But if you're traveling on a budget, there are many more things to do and see in Danang that are cheap or even free (like Bana national park).",
?곸뼱,Oct-18,1,Held captive I booked this hotel thinking it was a romantic place. But the only access is by cable car. The cable car is extra cost on top of your room rate. The food was poor. The restaurants are all owned by the hotel. They charge service fees on top of cost of meals. The room was small. I'd never want to return there as a guest again. It has an amusement arcade underneath. It's only good point is the pool. It's really good for families. Don't stay more than 1 night. Don't stay here if you have to catch an early flight in the morning as the cable car runs from 7.15am to 10pm. It's 30 minutes from top to bottom and then 40 minutes to the airport.,
?곸뼱,Oct-18,2,Boring & expensive Erm. What was that? Fake buildings with nothing inside. A couple of bland restaurants & the Golden Bridge. Bridge so packed that we couldn?셳 see much. Hard to take pictures due to all the people in the way. Fog covered all of the view anyway. Much of it still under construction. Very poor sign posts in English. Don?셳 bother. I think it?셲 more targeted to the Asian population or wedding parties. Don?셳 waste your time or money visiting.,
?곸뼱,Oct-18,1,"Cool ride up but.... Even tho it's over-priced I still recommend the ride up, particularly if you're into cable cars.  Pro tip 1. Find the cable car that goes directly to the top in one go.  We inadvertently took the slowest way which was 3 separate rides, which of itself is OK but you're forced to walk around the fake European themed buildings surrounded by hordes of Asian tourist taking ridiculous selfies to a backing track ok coughing hacking and way too loud music. Remember to keep an eye out for the 30 strong group tours where they all dress in the same ridiculous outfits and follow a flag holding tour leader.  Pro tip 2. Never get between a group tour and a good selfie spot or you'll be trampled to death.  Finally reaching the golden bridge, it was actually pretty MEH to look at, and its also crowded so you can barely walk faster than a shuffle. In the middle of the bridge there is a bunch of non-asian (I'm guessing caucasus region) people dressed up as Disney-esquecharacters with a donation box that people can can place a few measly notes in for a selfie with a slightly off looking snow white who looks like she'd be anywhere else in the world.  That bit was the cherry on the cake of this bizarre fractured fairy tale.  We managed a car to ourselves the ride down which was lovely and the best bit of the experience.",
?곸뼱,Mar-18,2,Do it once in your life If you are short with time and this is your first time in Vietnam I would not consider this place. Stay one more day in Hoi an for instance and do not waste your time,
?곸뼱,Oct-18,2,"Not worth the entrance price imo Visited this place to escape the heat, I don?셳 think it?셲 worth the price? A bit baffled by the five star reviews and the theme park and French village are just a bit too tacky. However the cable cars are good and if we had good weather I can imagine the bridge to look nice as well...",
?곸뼱,Oct-18,2,"Must go If you enjoyed Disneyland then you you will like this very busy amusement park. The cable car is 7.7 Klm high, the highest in Indochina. Wonderful day, enjoyed beers and food, amusement park. Fantastic day.",
?곸뼱,Oct-18,1,"Weak and fake version of disneyland If you have been in Europe, there is no need to go to this place. Its a plastic mini version of paris with a big arcade hall inside. The bridge is overrated. I would not recommend anyone to there.",
?곸뼱,Oct-18,2,Don?셳 waste your time. The cable car is the only interesting thing to see. Quite impressive. Don?셳 bother to waste too much time there. Fake French village on the top. Bridge with those hands is interesting. But if you didn?셳 go you haven?셳 missed anything.,
?곸뼱,Sep-18,1,"Not even sure where to start The pros:  Decent ride on the tram but caution to those (like me) not comfortable with heights. Seems sturdy/maintained and new enough so ok for the time being.  1 free beer ticket  The bumper cars were fun but 1/3 were out of service so the lineup moved slowly.  Bridge with hands nice (provided there are no clouds and hundreds of tourists). The pictures online look amazing but must've been a marketing promo to have it look as good as it does.  The Cons:  TACKY! Rides abysmal, a joke really, except for the drop ride. Maybe ok for kids? They'd likely enjoy all the arcade games, 3, 4, & 5 ""D"" movies, but honestly its the most bizarre place. Seems there is a certain type of ""tourist"" this would be geared to. They were there in droves.  The ""funcular"" was a joke....3 min going 0,5 miles. What was that even?...just a way to move people to the next ""level""  A totally fake French town with mis-spelled famous areas, weird combos of things (French art paired with men dressed like ninjas), some dancers looked tired and were just going through the motions but clearly weren't into it, weird ""pumpkin land"" where there is apples and pumpkins and fake potted flowers(what even is that?), the loudest music throughout and at the ninja/french picture station they had sexually suggestive music the tourists rocked out to, but not understanding the words it was like an accident scene you can't turn your eyes from.  It was an accident scene that went on way too long. We spent way too much. It would have been ok to do the trip in the cable car and the bridge but everything else was a complete waste of time.  1 star was far too generous.",
?곸뼱,Sep-18,1,"Huge waste of time and expensive We really wanted to see the new golden bridge that had been built so decided to take the trip up Ba Na Hills. The journey from our hotel in DaNang (private taxi that waited for us whilst we explored the hills) was 650,000. We were told the journey would take around 2 hours both ways but it actually took around an hour which was a welcome relief. We collected our tickets on the way which were 700,000 per person, therefore we hoped to experience lots of culture and history. When we arrived we rode the longest cable car to the top of the mountain which took around 20mins, we were able to get straight on and each family/ group was able to have their own car up. Arriving at the top, you immediately see the new golden bridge, which whilst makes for a lovely photo, is in fact very small with no real meaning for its existence, very much felt like a Tourist trap. We explored around and there was limited information and felt like we had arrived in Alice in Wonderland. We made it over to the French village and it was no more than an overrated ?쁳heme park??with two rides that you had to pay extra for. The ?쁵illage??was merely a cluster of fast food restaurants. Over all the biggest tourist trap, waste of time and completely over priced. We spent 2 hours here which was 2 hours too long.",
?곸뼱,Sep-18,2,"Give it a miss We thought we would visit as the golden bridge has recently gone viral in the UK. If we was to compare it to a UK park, think Blackpool but worse. There isn?셳 really much to do there. Even though they are still building the park, it?셲 quite dilapidated. What was more frustrating was the other tourists, pushing in front of line and generally being rude. Not very good value for money.",
?곸뼱,Nov-17,2,Eco tourism lover Sorry folks. This place doesn't cut it for me. Environmental destruction in the name of tourism. Once visited. Never again,
?곸뼱,Sep-18,1,"The best part? The cable cars! The worst part? It's the only redeeming feature Wow - this was a pretty abysmal experience.  If the world's worst tourist trap met the rejected budget-challenged step-sibling of a Universal Studios, and then they had a baby (or, more accurately, a Joint Venture), it would be Ba Na Hills.  The whole European medieval look was a facade in more ways than one. Venture into the restrooms, and oof, you're very quickly reminded that the people who visit this wannabe destination lack social graces and even basic etiquette. None of the 3 restrooms we visited had soap. Why? Beats me.  The sub-standard rides were disappointing when they work. I mean, I don't even know how to describe it in a way that would make me seem too charitable.  If I was pressed to say something good about Ba Na Hills, I'll allow that the cable car rides up and down were pretty cool, but only if you were lucky enough to get fellow passengers who did not feel like they had to bellow to be heard.  Seriously, save your time and money, and give this Ba Na Na location a miss.",
?곸뼱,Sep-18,2,"Probably the weirdest experience of my life So where do we begin with this one. We were a bit sceptical when we found out it was impossible to hike or drive up to the golden bridge since that was the only thing we wanted to see. After forking out the 700k each we decided to spend a decent amount of time in the theme park itself. First of all, the cable car up is fantastic! The views are incredible. All the way up we discussed how and why they had built the pillars without any access route for maintenance etc (fascinating). When we arrived at the golden bridge we were disappointed to see it was very foggy. Could barely see the hands. But since this was our #1 reason for coming we waited for 15-20 mins and the fog had disappeared. The bridge is totally OK. Nothing more, nothing less. I thought it would be more spectacular but unfortunately as someone else here pointed out, it is just painted plaster...  Then we went up to the totally misplaced french village. I have absolutely no idea who decided building this fake European village on top of a mountain in Vietnam, and being European we were left with a mixed sensation of awe, bewilderment and a mild shock. Firstly, it looks stupid. You can tell immediately the buildings are fake. Secondly they have hired European looking people to work as entertainers. For some reason this seems like the main attraction to the asians visiting the park since they were queuing to take pictures with some Russian man on stilts and a french pirate. Now, we were actually looking forwards to some rides, but it turned out there were none. 95% overpriced restaurants and hotels and 5% shops. After 30 mins of amazement we got the giggles at how weird it all was and decided to go back down to reality. Cable car ride down was fantastic again which helped smooth out the very weird experience from on top! Would recommend coming with ur mates and getting on the piss to have a very fun day.",
?곸뼱,Sep-18,2,"Commercialized BS Tourist Trap. Wanted to hike up the hill instead of pay for a gondola ride, but I guess they outlawed it. Plus there were tourists everywhere. Not good nature and not authentic. Maybe not terrible, but poor compared to my expectations.",
?곸뼱,Aug-18,2,"Probably like taking Codine in an abandoned retail park that was unexplainably busy. I actually recommend going. The cable car ride back down was largely punctuated by a stunned silence as everyone in our group tried to figure out what exactly had just happened.  We went to Danang as we had been told that the cable car ride and hand bridge were a must see. In fairness, the cable car ride was pretty good. We spent most of the ride up debating how the hell they built the pylons without any clear access route to each one (we're cool like that). If it was for 5 - 10 USD, I would recommend getting the cable car up to the top. Turning 180 degrees and coming straight back down again. Don't look back. Cut your losses.  But it costs more than that. So you're going to want value for money. Naively you press on. You arrive at the bridge. The Golden Hand Bridge of myth and legend. It is the most OK thing I have ever seen. The Giant Hands hold the bridge triumphantly out from the rock, covered in painted on moss so you almost can't tell they're made of plaster and concrete. The view is quite good, but the view from the cable car is way better (it might actually be awesome at sunset though). Unfortunately not much can be said for the functionality of the bridge since it essentially takes you back to the same building it starts at, so 0/10 for original bridge purposes. The major redeeming feature however is the entertainers on the bridge. It looks like the park hired hundreds of actors to stand on the bridge and take selfies from just about every single angle possible for seemingly all day. I assume they're actors because surely no sane person would want to do that. They provide a fun obstacle against getting across, livening up the experience of walking, an ever more mundane activity in today's day and age. Be prepared to dodge, dip, duck, dive and dodge around selfie sticks and invisible lines of sight between photographer and pretend instagram influencer as you try to cross this underwhelming 150 meters in under half an hour.  Now you've done the best bits, lets crack on to the next 80% of your day.  I'll try and keep this quick.  Its a fake french town, made of the same authentic concrete and plaster mix. Its absolutely packed. There is a large square with music blaring and a crowd gathered round. When you investigate you will see a troupe of dancers dressed up in various 'traditional European costumes' performing the native dance of those countries, paired with the native music for those countries. We got an odd feeling the dancers weren't allowed to leave. Oh and there was a Brazilian carnival dance too - obviously.  Once you've torn yourself from... that, you can go and visit the fake church. Its a gigantic fake church, complete with fake stained glass windows, fake stone pillars and a massive fake bible. You knock on the stone pillar and hear it make a hollow wooden sound. You wonder if the massive fake Jesus makes the same sound. You decide its probably better to leave it.  But anyway, time to brush this off with the Octoberfest held in August (its not actually open during October). Try some terrible beer. Decide its probably not worth finishing.  Queue for one of the rides. Get to the point in the queue where you see the ride. Change your mind and leave the queue, since walking looks like a more adrenaline fuelled activity.  Go for some food. The staff look confused, and not aware they're running a restaurant. Pay the most you've paid so far on your trip for the worst you've eaten so far. Find out retrospectively that the wet wipes also incur a cost.  Go into the weird castle thing out of morbid curiosity....  HOLY MOLY ITS A MASSIVE ARCADE AND ITS ALL FREE!!!!  And if theres more than one of you, the fact that its absolutely terrible makes it absolutely incredible. The ghost train is delayed so stuff jumps out at you after you've passed it. The simulators move so little you will get a cramp from laughing so hard as your adrenaline fuelled race across the desert mildly wobbles your chair. In fairness I properly hit my head in the mirror maze, 10/10 the sign of a good mirror maze. And the drop ride almost drops you at 1g, so it almost feels like you're falling for a few meters.  We had a great moment as we were leaving this building, three of us commented on how big the cat coming through the turnstiles was... until we all realised it was a monkey.  The monkey also loved the arcade.  So yeah, overall a monument to the vaguely bizarre. Its not trying to be... it just kind of is. Oh and the weirdest part, is that no one else there seemed to be having an even slightly similar experience to us. It seemed perfectly normal to them. So maybe it was just us.  I think its just a generic corporate entertainment venture nestled in otherwise unspoilt jungle, that probably seems stranger to outsiders than it does to its target market.  Overall I would genuinely recommend it, just to have the weird experience of getting inside a universe that seems to be the collective brainchild of CS Lewis, Walt Disney and Sylvia Plath.  I hope the staff are ok.  Enjoy the cable car. Go straight to the arcade. Pack a picnic.",
?곸뼱,Aug-18,1,"dont waste time & $ nothing particular except the hands. Just some castles, white dancers. Boring and crowded. I dont recommend it at all. should spend more time relax on beach than this place",
?곸뼱,Aug-18,2,Waste of money We went to Ba Na hills because we wanted to see the scenery and golden bridge but left feeling like it was a waste of money.  If you want to go up bana hills you have to pay the whole 30US which includes the amusment park but apart from the view there is not much more to it.  The Mecure at Bana Hills looked like a decent restaurant but in reality it is an over priced vendor that advertise one thing and provide another. In their menu they have photos of the food items and when they comes out the portions are 1/4 of the advertised photo. When I brought this up to the staff they insisted the photo is just a 'sample' which is ridiculous. I asked them to take it away as it was way to over priced and not as advertised.  If you're looking at going to Ba Na hills we found it cheaper to find your own driver and then just pay for a ticket. The guide here really is unnecessary and they take you to a place they like for lunch which is commissioned based.,
?곸뼱,Aug-18,2,"A bit disappointed!! Well the bridge was absolutely incredible, but when traveling on a backpacker budget we were asking ourselves why isn't there an option to go only with the cable car to see the bridge without paying for the whole place which isn't even fully constructed, the place is open till """"21:00"""""" but everything closes at four,so in conclusion we were kind of bummed by this place.",
?곸뼱,Aug-18,2,"Not what it?셲 hyped up to be I was quite disappointed with Ba Na Hills. The best part of this location is definitely the cable car ride. The Golden Bridge and the theme park were really subpar. From all of the social media reviews of the Golden Bridge, I found it to be quite small and other than two large hands holding it up, not much to see. The scenery is beautiful but there were so many people, you couldn?셳 get a picture if you tried. The theme park was an attempt at Disneyland but far less interesting. For the price they charge for this site, you may want to reconsider.",
?곸뼱,Aug-18,1,"Waste of time & over priced My partner and I were really looking forward to visiting the golden bridge after viewing it on various social media sites.  This place is over priced,over rated and a complete disappointment. If you are completely wasted or of Asian origin (the Japanese and Korean tourists seemed to love it, taking lots of photos), you may well like the place, however don?셳 visit if not. The bridge was mildly interesting, though very small in comparison to pictures/videos on social media. The attraction in general was bizarre. The site itself was very beautiful, but a horrible cliche of France and Germany. There were awful entertainers at every corner and there was very little to do other than question if you were on some weird trip.",
?곸뼱,Aug-18,1,"WHAT IS THE POINT?! Apart from the cable car ride, what is the point of this place?! Do not understand how it has so many good reviews.....  This place has literally been created for the selfie culture. Nothing cultural or authentic about it at all.  There is literally nothing to do once you have completed the cable car up the mountain and seen the view. The most impressive (and only) attraction is the bridge which is too crowded with selfie taking tourists for you to even get a decent look in.  We then proceeded to walk around the gardens and the wine cellar which was literally just a narrow winding corridor made to look like a wine cellar with fake barrels ending at a wine cafe, encouraging you to buy bad wine at extortionate prices.  A second cable car up the mountain takes you to a FAKE, 'french style' village which as no authenticity whats so ever with nothing to do at all. There were random acts of Ukrainian dancers, and people dressed up as princes and princesses with no context at all. I did not understand the concept of why they were there.  We were given a free beer token to use in the beer palace, a massive building with blasting music, no atmosphere and only one beer tap. Actors were dressed up in traditional dutch dress and regrettably walking round 'cheer-sing' confused customers. All very confusing and random.  All the Westerns on our tour were very confused as to what the point of this place is, especially when we have the likes of Disney Land to compare it with.  Complete waste of a day and a rip off, food and drink was the worst we had in Vietnam and the most expensive!",
?곸뼱,Aug-18,2,"So boring We rented motorbikes to visit Sunworld and Ba Na Hills from Hoi An. The drive there was about hour, quite straightforward, and probably the most fun part of the day. The only thing worth seeing there is the hand bridge. Even that is pushing it as it is literally just a bridge, nothing to do there. The rest of the park just seemed like it was a money making scam with no legitimate attractions. The food was terrible, and they enforce the fines for leftover food at the buffet. There were also hardly any staff in sight for inquiries. Don't go out of your way, but if you're struggling to find something to do, which you probably won't be on Hoi An or Danang, it's there.",
?곸뼱,Aug-18,1,"Terrible! I will never come back. We went there this afternoon because the ticket for cable car is cheaper after 4 pm, it took us 30-40 minutes finding a guard or any employee because there is no one on the information and cashier and we almost got lost trying to find the place where we can buy the cable car tickets.  Take note that I'm with my Vietnamese friend. She asked the employee questions regarding the cable car in Vietnamese and the employee responded in Vietnamese. They gave us false information about the ride, we didn't know that the cable car is up until 8pm only.  If she only gave my Vietnamese friend the correct information, we would have been to the bridge (because that is the reason why we traveled from hanoi to danang to see and walk on it) So, to make the long story short. We didn't get to see the bridge because the employee gave us wrong information.  When we arrived on the ground we found our way to the hotel. There is a service e-car for guests but the driver said that it is only for his family and we cannot ride it. It is literally the service electric vehicle for the guest and he used it for his family.  Very terrible experience, not worth the time and effort to go there.",
?곸뼱,Jul-18,2,Strange mixture of artificial built among spectacular natural environments A confusingly designed entertainment complex imitating old castles in Europe. Mainly to attract Asians and those who only seen European castles through movies and television. Lately they also added huge Buddha statues and temples to attract more people. These are fake temples built only for commercial purposes. Now they added this pedestrian bridge also as a curiosity. The whole park is a strange mixture of artificial structures with no clear concept. I don?셳 think it even fit to be called a theme park.The only worthy part is the cable car ride through spectacular scenery. Nothing else is worth either time or money.,
?곸뼱,Aug-18,2,"Think carefully before you go. If you have romantic notions of discovering a French mountain retreat then you will be disappointed. What you get is a Disney land experience with next to no authenticity. Yes, the French wine cellars can be explored but there is not much more that survives from the French colonial period. However, the mountain setting is beautiful and the cable car ride up and down is worth doing for the scenery and views of Da Nang district and South China Sea. Trouble is tickets are only available for the full amusement park package, which is not cheap. On balance not recommended.",
?곸뼱,Jun-18,2,"Quite disappointed to visit the Ba Na Hills It is quite disappointed to go to this place. Firstly the cable car and entrance fee is quite expensive (VND700,000), secondly there is no public transport to go there, so you have to hire a car, take a taxi or join a tour. Though it holds Guinness World Records, I did not get the spectacular view while taking the cable cars. It's an old French hill station before and now is converted to an amusing park. Nothing special except the weather is a bit cool, so it is much comfortable. Compared to other theme parks in other countries, this is not be my cup!",
?곸뼱,Jul-18,2,"Expensive and too many tourists When we arrived everything was full of tourists, we had to wait a long time until we could actually go on the cable car and were pretty disappointed on the top. Flower garden is nice but you are through in 30 minutes. The bridge is very nicely made and the views amazing.  We had a buffet lunch included in our tour which was okay but nothing special. The time for the attractions was way too short since we had to wait 0.5-1.5h for the roller coasters. All in all for us not a great experience but we are all not the tourist place people and like to explore things by ourselves and not on schedule.",
?곸뼱,Jul-18,2,Avoid if you don?셳 like crowds This place is a purely commercial enterprise catering to large tour groups. Whilst the gardens were beautiful and the cable car ride was fun the rest of the venture is overrated. We got caught in a downpour which stopped the cable car running & it was bedlam trying to queue for the return cable car. People pushing & shoving. Chaos!,
?곸뼱,Jun-18,1,Horrible trip It was not a place to go for vacation. It was so poor organized. The worst thing was exhausted long queue. Not much attractive things but expensive. I will never come back.,
?곸뼱,Jun-18,2,Pretty rubbish Definitely not worth to 700k entrance ticket and nearly 1 million VND for a return taxi journey from Da Nang city. Just a glorified food court at the top of a mountain. The cable car ride up was the only thing worth doing. Waste of time.,
?곸뼱,Jun-18,2,"Amazing cable car trips but nothing else I must admit the scenary from cable car rides were amazing. But soon as you get up there... too many people (and with selfie sticks) pushing you around, I nearly had a claustrophobic attack. Thank God our driver was a near by I could've get out of there soon enough. Would I recommend the overall experience? I would say no.",
?곸뼱,Jun-18,2,"Disappointed The cable car ride up the hill was great. The view and temperature were nice. However, because we are travelling in a group packaged tour, and by the time we checked-in @ Mecure, it was already 3pm. So after touring around the temple, wine cellar, garden and the ""Big' Buddha, it's already 5pm. We didn't even got a chance to visit the sourvenir stores to get even a magnet!!! Then there is the Theme park, guess what?? It closed @ 5pm too ... but because there are still visitors playing in there, some of the rides like a 4D and 5D are still available but until 6pm, the staffs will all leave .... the arcade games are free though ....",
?곸뼱,Jun-18,1,A nightmare on a most beautiful hill The best part about the visit is the cable car ride (and I am afraid of cable car rides). The view from the cable car is truly spectacular but we got an even better view on our way to Hue. Once you get to the first stop the nightmare begins. The natural surroundings - bird song and cricket calls - are drown out by the horrid French lounge music blasting at every single corner. There are people everywhere and artificial theme park buildings peppering the landscape. I don't think I have ever been to a more aesthetically awful place. Avoid it. Really.,
?곸뼱,Jun-18,2,Crowded place A visit to this high resort is nice if not for the crowd. The queue for the luge was horrendous and to queue for 1.5 hrs for it was not worth it. Construction was going on at many places. The cable ride up was nice. The tourists from China were horrible.,
?곸뼱,Jun-18,1,"The worst but perfect view Listen to your follower Europeans, this is not a very enjoyable place to go to. It's a themepark of an European french village, but in reality they're mixing a lot of cultural aspects, for example some time statues here, some flower gardens there, a bit of Japanese tea house in some other stop and a Bavarian beer something? It's does not have a lot of rides or anything, food more expensive for Vietnamese standards. The queues are really long  Some positive aspects are the cable ride and it's phenomenal view ! Also the heat is not as bad.  Anyway I feel like this was the biggest waste of my money",
?곸뼱,Jun-18,1,"Ba Na Hill Vietnam Disney - costly and crowded My family and I went to Ba Na hill yesterday. What a nightmare from start to finish. While the views are beautiful, the crowds and lack of safety made this a horrible experience. We were herded into a waiting area with thousands ( no joke) of people to wait for the cable car. People were so closely packed together and pushing , every time there was movement, people would push and trample. Just crazy! We waited over an hour . When we got to the cable cars ( that hold 12 max), people were pushing to get on and sitting on each other's laps just to get in. 17 people packed in a car. The restaurants and rides were the same once we got to the hill, way over crowded, people pushing in lines and cutting in the lines. This places was absolutely insane ! We have lived in Vietnam for a year now and never been anywhere this bad. This is an extremely expensive day, plan on at least $250 for three people and we couldn't even get on the rides bec the line ups were over 2 hours long. Sadly, the old French village was torn down and re built new by the Govt so you can't even see the old heritage, many more beautiful places to see, don't waste your time or money.",
?곸뼱,Jun-18,1,"Don?셳 bother Worst experience ever. Spend most of the time queuing.... Rude locals shoving and jumping queues, they don?셳 seem to understand the concept of queuing. Worsened by lack of crowd control by the staff... extremely dangerous... people pushing when boarding the cable car. Staff did not bother monitoring the number of people entering a cable car which exceeded the limit!!! Food was overpriced and bad. Did I mention the unreasonably expensive entrance ticket? Don?셳 bother coming here. It was easily one of the worst holiday experience ever.",
?곸뼱,Jun-18,1,Tourist Trap Expensive entrance ticket that does not justify the entire experience. The queue on a Saturday was horrendous and they had poor crowd control. Everyone was pushing impatiently and we spent the bulk of the time queuing for the cable cars.,
?곸뼱,May-18,2,"Only cablecar access We travelled there by motorbike on a rather boring mostly straight road expecting a scenic road to the top. However the road goes only to an expensive cablecar station which is now the only access to ba na. Whilst the views are great from the cablecar what awaits on top we didn't find so great. It may be suitable for families with children but has little to offer for those of us seeking a cool rainforest respite from danang. Reminded me of penang hill, where at least there is a walking option to get up. Disappointed. ..",
?곸뼱,Jun-18,1,"Worst Experience EVER When I went to Bana Hill and after 30 minutes rain was seriously pouring. Even rain stopped sometimes during the day, all of things were surrounded by fog. I couldn't see anything outside of Bana Hill. There was no choice but to go inside. What a horrible. Many of game machines broken or were missing its parts, so there were few machines to play. Crowded inside but lack of facilities. So most visitors just were sitting inside on chair or floor, and waiting for the rain to stop. Furthermore, some guys smoked inside. And some people said the cable car stopped awhile and they were dangled in the sky a few minutes. Staff were kind. Always tried to help visitors and show smile brightly. But not enough. If you have visited Europe many times, or weather is not good, Visiting Bana Hill is WASTE YOUR MONEY. There is no value being inside of Bana Hill. I recommend you eat tasty food or get massage instead of visiting this place.",
?곸뼱,Jun-18,2,"Bad visitors and terrible management It was saturday I went. View and weather were great. Facilities are quite fun for kids. Buildings are artificial, you can take many nice photos.  Local visitors and other travelers seldom queue. They kept pushing me even when I was trying to get in the fuxxing cable car. They just can't wait few more seconds to let others ahead to get in. It was so dangerous and extremely rude.  I had terrible experience when I was trying to queue. But the most unacceptable part was the staffs did nothing to control the queue.

?곸뼱,May-18,1,"Faux European mountain village In theme park style. Cable car ride is nice, until you reach the low hanging clouds. Be ready for cooler weather.

Once you reach the ?쐖illage??prepare for hordes of ?쁲elfie-addicts?? They are everywhere. Other than that there is a theme park atmosphere with street foods and restaurants/shops but not a lot of actual theme park attractions. A gaming hall, a Wax museum which requires you to buy an additional ticket on top of the D 700,000 entrance fee for the park. Also a ?쁉urrasic??exhibit (Dino?셲 not to scale) that inexplicably also features cavemen, mammoths and sabre tooth tigers. There are Central European style buildings and also an Asian corner with temples. All in all a hotchpotch which to me personally was not worth the trip and money. There is just nothing authentic about the whole thing but doesn?셳 offer enough fantasy to qualify as a theme park.",
?곸뼱,Mar-18,1,Terrible place All I can say is avoid this meaningless place. The cable car ride was great but the destination left a lot to be desired. Tacky at its best if you have any shred of good taste left in your body don't test it here.An area of beautiful mountain forests destroyed by this monstrosity.,
?곸뼱,Apr-18,2,"Probably one of the weirdest places we have ever been. Cable car was good though I would only recommend this place for the cable car up/down if you can justify the price for a cable car ride. The park itself at the top I think is meant to be ""Vietnamese Disneyland"" we did not really get it, it was all a little strange... We booked a driver to take us there intending to spend the day exploring, we struggled to make it 2 hours before calling our driver to come pick us up. We could not get out of there fast enough. Save your money and go elsewhere.",
?곸뼱,Apr-18,2,"Not worth to go - honestly I went to BaNa Hills today. Very good weather. I seldom write reviews, hope it is helpful to you.  Unless you are really into theme parks and want to explore every ""theme park"" in the world, you dont need be there. Disneyland, Universal Studio are way better. I did not have bad experience there. Staff are nice and all seemed ok, but i dont recommned it.  First of all, regarding the selling point ""the longest cable car"", it could somehow be.... it is very boring indeed as there is nothing attractive along the way, and you will largely be accompanied by locals in the cart on the way, who spoke loudly for 30mins unless you really dont care. It was a bit torturing to me for my round trip  Second, the park is not well organzied or a bit dated. the Fantasy park is packed with some outdated electronic games and the area has ""international performances"". The flower gardens are obvisouly lack of design and aesthetics. I dont know how to describe it, but not very good. No good relaxing area or beautiful scenes but some man-made buildings.  Instead, i would recommend you either pick other spots in Danang or simply stay at your hotel for a sunbathe.",
?곸뼱,Mar-18,2,"New but not impressed With the price you paid, this attraction was not up to par. Cable car is probably the high light of the trip. Many man-made sceneries which I found cheesy. Foggy on the top of the mountain...Can't see the whole city at all.",
?곸뼱,Mar-18,1,"Rude Employees & Don?셳 believe the lady at the ticket office We went here with 3 families (13 people in total). When you arrive you go to an office to buy your tickets. The lady came out to measure the children. We had 2 children who were the height of adults, 4 who were the normal children height and one who we were told ?쐀aby height so no pay.??We purchased our tickets and went to the entrance, which is quite a long walk.  When we got there the lady told us that ?쐀aby need to pay.??We told her that the lady measured her and we were told she didn?셳 need a ticket. She replied ?쐙ou are lying.?? Why would we lie?? We already bought 12 tickets why would we not buy another one??  This was absolutely insulting as we would never dare lie!  I would definitely recommend taking a video of the lady measuring your children so you can show the entrance people or you?셪l be accused to lying what she said. It?셲 a long walk back to the office to where the ticket office is from the entrance and if your already past the gate but your child isn?셳, you can?셳 get out or you have to pay again! Ridiculous!!  We won?셳 be back..",
?곸뼱,Mar-18,2,Simply Expensive and Overrated As per the title: terribly expensive and overrated. Nothing much and the crowd is quite massive. Should have more rides and activities.,
?곸뼱,Mar-18,1,Not worth the money Entrance fee is too expensive costing 650000 for an adult. Nothing to see there and will never visit again.,
?곸뼱,Mar-18,1,"Horrible Terrible, place Don't waste your money or time. Trust me this place sucks big time. You will regret if you choose to go.",
?곸뼱,Mar-18,2,"Not worth the money I didn't really enjoy myself at this place. It's overpriced and way too many tourists who will push in front of you and have no manners. We went with a guided tour, which was the mistake on our behalf. If you do decide to go. Get a private driver or go yourself really early. Depending on the day will depend on what you can and can't see from the mountains. It does have a scenic view on the way up in the Gondola but that's about it. To me it was a wasted day in Da Nang.",
?곸뼱,Mar-18,1,"Horrible experience, avoid this place! Total Scam! Sun World at Ba Na Hills is totally a scam. They say they close 2 of their attractions at 5 PM and that the rest of the park stays open till 9 PM. The truth is that by 5:30 the entire park is a ghost town and everything in is closed. The entire Sun World only has 3 rides in the entire place, the arcades are not free, there is a 3D and 4D cinema and a sad wax museum.  Staff does not speak any English and signage around the park is confusing.  The place closes at 5:30 but they keep two restaurants open so they can say the are open till 9 PM. Even the cable car closes and if you miss the 5:45 PM window you will be stranded at the top with heavy mist for another hour till they open up again. They never tell you that tje cable car closes in between 5:30 and 9 PM either. There was little kids just sitting in the mist getting wet bacause they would not let you into the cable car line forcing tourists to go into the restaurants for that hour wait.  Shame on you Sun World.  Total scam.  Worst experience in Vietnam. Will never visit Sun World.",
?곸뼱,Mar-18,1,"Waste of time Overpriced and absolute waste of time. Weather there was nice and cooling but other than that, u find yourself in a fake French town",
?곸뼱,Mar-18,2,"Boring except for cable car Food was pretty deplorable and the rides dinky. Except for the cable car, which was impressive, the attractions were sub par and resembled a poor knockoff of Universal Studios.",
?곸뼱,Feb-18,1,Waste of time Artificial sites. The only natural wonder is the scenery from the cables. Even then it?셲 just green mountains. No other point to being there. Google the mountain images of you really want to see it. Save your time  The buffet there is impressive until you have to fight a swarm of Chinese tourists guzzling down food and you don?셳 get any of the few good dishes available.,
?곸뼱,Feb-18,2,"Totally Fake The best part of the visit is the lengthy cable car rides up and down, over the jungle and through the clouds (depending on the weather). However be prepared for queuing to get on board.  Apparently historically this is where the French colonials came up into the hills during summer to experience lower temperatures and when we went it was definitely at least 6 deg.C lower than at sea level.  Otherwise only visit this place if you like kitsch. On top of the hill is a fake European village (appears to be modelled on Carcassonne), which is just a shopping and dining destination like Main Street in Disney.  Unless you really have nothing else to do to fill your time I would not recommend.",
?곸뼱,Feb-18,2,"Cheesy theme park The Ba Na Hills themselves are beautiful. Unfortunately, the main way to visit them is through the Sun World theme park (the famous big tram to the mountains is part of the theme park). Ironically, the Vietnamese destroyed what was once a French colonial resort on this site and now have created a sort of Epcot Center style theme park that is a Disney version of old France. A Vietnamese tour guide told me this park was built primarily to entertain the many Korean and mainland Chinese tourists who vacation at the Da Nang area. You won?셳 find many locals at all. The park is very crowded with families and selfie stick wielding kids. There are a few bright spots: besides the beauty of the hills, the park features some nice Buddhist temples here and there - which are a nice respite from the chaos of the park. If you are coming to Vietnam to experience Vietnamese culture, avoid this place.",
?곸뼱,Jan-18,1,"Nah, wouldn't recommend Not worth the trip on a cloudy day, or to be honest ever. Would still be searching for a coffee if I was still up there. Cable car was cool but apart from that, zero directions as to where to go and an odd vibe from the start. Save your money and time on this one.",
?곸뼱,Jan-18,2,"Dissapointed trip We enjoyed the weather and the cable car ride. It cost us, 2 person VND1.3mil. and up the hill is a theme park. If u are looking for a nature, trekking and view... Not worth the money.",
?곸뼱,Jan-18,2,"Full of Rude Koreans The trip was fun. Good service.  But crowded with Koreans, they were very rude. When we were having buffet lunch, they took all the seafood and left nothing but soup. Also they push their dirty dishes to our table. They took the whole tissue box from our table to theirs without any tissue for us to use.  Next, they were talkative, and very anoying in the cable car. Do not share your ride with them.",
?곸뼱,Jan-18,1,"Do not go if rainy as it is very foggy It is a theme park with little special features except that it is situated at 1500M high so you can have some good views while on The cable cars. The place Is basically overcrowded with Chinese and Korean. You can expect to queue for A few hours just for the cable cars, funicular train and every ride. It was so foggy on my visit that I could not even see a few metres ahead.",
?곸뼱,Jan-18,1,"Soooo bad!!!! It is possibly one of the worst ways I?셶e ever spent my time. The sky rail ride up and back is the best part of the whole experience. If you want to escape Vietnam for a day and go to a random theme park then you may quite possibly enjoy it but if not avoid, avoid, avoid. We also had the worst meals of our lives at the Mercure hotel at the top.",
?곸뼱,Dec-17,2,Totally Meh on a wet day Unfortunately we went on cold wet day (about 12 degrees celcius). Visibility was about 1m. Family made their own fun but was a waste of a day. Others have had fantastic time with clear weather. No point in going on wet or overcast day.,
?곸뼱,Jan-18,1,"Terrible place to visit If you have ever been to a decent amusement park before, do not waste your time here. There are only a few rides for adults. It is so tiny so there aren't many things to do. What we did there for over one and a half hours is this.",
?곸뼱,Jan-18,2,"Not a good place in January Danang The cable car trip lasted 25 mins . I do believe the views will be much better in summer time. I saw waterfall Through the mist. It liked we have been to heaven as we went through the mist (sighed) . When we arrived the peak, we could not barely see the architects...... It also rained.  Luckily, we got free raincoats at the information center. We walked to the fantasy park. We played the 5D game. We wore the glasses, sat on a horse back and had a gun for shooting. It was funny and free of charge  All in all, we chose a bad time to go there. Would be much better if the sky is clear.",
?곸뼱,Jan-18,1,"Dont waste your money Really a very commercial enterprise with little history, sad to say. Seemed expensive for getting a lift up a mountain to do shopping. Ba Na...in the middle of nowhere.....perhaps a good choice for it :)",
?곸뼱,Dec-17,2,Foggy mountain See nothing except fog. Cable car ride was good. Check weather before visit. Too expensive. Overpriced.,
?곸뼱,Dec-17,1,"Washed out , not worth the time Very commercialized, washed out due to bad weather. Honestly don't think it's worth the trip. Except for the cable car ride.",
?곸뼱,Dec-17,2,"The cable car is amazing, the rest not so much Hmm, Ba Na Hills is a very expensive day for a family by Viet standards. The cable car that takes you up the mountains is really cool at 5km long and I'd say over 1000 metres' elevation.  However, what awaits you at the top is not, in my opinion worth spending 20/30 bucks on. Essentially, it's a fake french theme park. Whilst you'll see the history of the area touted eveyrwhere, keep in mind it was blown to smithereens during the war; everything you're seeing is a recent reconstruction (I had to chuckle in the ""wine cellar"", stocking that famous australian vintage jacobs creek, one of our cheaper wines).  We were there in at the height of off season on a freezing and cloudy day and I still thought the place was packed with tourists - I can't imagine what it's like in summer. Squeezing past herds of people taking selfies is kinda frustrating, and there were still queues for popular rides in the amusement park.  The park itself, like many a theme park in developing countries, is a weird mix of genuinely cool stuff (free arcade games, some of the larger rides), total crap, bizarre rides and shows, and stuff that's a total rip off. Our kids are 3 and 6 and it was good for them, anyone over ten, though wouldn't be impressed. It's not really a theme park in the proper sense of the word.  The lunch buffet was large, but the quality was pretty bad and it was also packed to the point where we couldn't' get a table together for 4 people. On the bright side it dies down quite quickly around one o'clock.  For me, the cable car was worth it alone, but I wouldn't go near the place in high season.",
?곸뼱,Dec-17,2,"Nice cable ride not worth the lining up The cable car rides had amazing views and the architecture of the buildings were very nice. The food was overpriced just like any theme park. There weren't many rides either for adults and the lining up process was a nightmare. Put Chinese tourists with local Vietnamese into the mix and you get individuals who seem to think they are above everyone else and WILL push into the one hour long line. Even if you tell them off in their own language (I know both Mandarin and Vietnamese), they will pretend you don't exist and ignore you. Utter scum.  The price of entry was 650k vnd and I prefered Asia Park any day. Ba Na hills is more for the scenic people. The place is swamped by tourists, so if you like big crowds of Chinese and Korean tourists, this place is for you.  Also, the staff won't do anything when they see people cutting into the long lines. Enjoy the line cutters.",
?곸뼱,Dec-17,2,"- I stayed at Ba Na Hills from 5-7 December . There are many pros and cons to this place.  (Pros)  The staff are well-mannered and the scenery is amazing . On a clear day , the view going up and down the cable car is amazing . I would recommend staying th",
?곸뼱,Nov-17,2,"Over price Came here in a sunshine day in town, when I tool the cable ride to the middle of the mountain, started raining and later were bad experience activities in wet, messy on the top of the mountain",
?곸뼱,Nov-17,1,"Terrible experience & bad customer service The venue should have been closed considering there was nothing but a windy rainstorm and heavy fog up top. There was no sight seeing unless you were a feet close to the object. 10 of us spent a lot of money to go up just to eat lunch and when we came out of the restaurant, everything was closed. We tried to ask for reimbursement, but was left hanging from the customer service. The people running the customer service desk were far from helpful and talked about us in Vietnamese thinking we didn't understand them, but someone in our group understood. The girl that was suppose to help us named Nguyen Thi Yen Nhi was not hospitable, gave attitude and completely ignored us. Instead she was just chatting on her computer messenger without acknowledging us and letting us stand there waiting for 2 hours until the place closed. She was even telling all the other staff in Vietnamese, one name Nguyen Huu Vinh, that we were lying about the terrible weather and everything being closed even after we showed her pictures of the bad conditions from when we were up there. She then called another staff member named Dang T. Kim Nhung who posed and stated that she was the manager but upon arrival, Nhung didn't even resolve the issue, told us to wait, and then just left us standing in the lobby without a word until we were forced to leave because all of Ba Na Hills staff disappeared except the securities. Hope this review helps future tourists that want to attend this attraction.",
?곸뼱,Oct-17,2,"bad weather ruin the mood Before we took the cable car竊똳he weather was just cloudy on the ground. then, when the cable car climb to the higher level, the weather become so windy moist and rainy, a total different with the ground floor. my shoes was all wet after 5 mins walking outside. dont even mention sightseeing, becoz u could bearly walk outsides in such a heavy rain and wind. at last, my memory at ba na hills was only the hotel rooms, games centre, swimming pools, as all these facilities were indoors.",
?곸뼱,Sep-17,2,"Amazing cable car but.... The drive from Hoi An took about an hour and if you're a fan of cable cars/gondala's this one is spectacular! It was the longest in the world when it was built in 2007 and gives a spectacular view high above the tree canopy. However, after that it was all downhill! Vietnamese Disneyland meets French Village with very little open, construction going on everywhere and very tacky. Not worth the drive or entrance fee. If you've ever been to Paris it will make you cringe as it is a really poor imitation. Lucky for us there were few people so at least we didn't have to wait to get on a cable car to go back down the mountain. Much better ways to spend time and money in Hoi An.",
?곸뼱,Sep-17,2,"Overated and expensive Place is overated, the entrance to this place is crazy VND 650.000. Okay I had nowhere else to go on that day and decided to travel here. About 40 minutes motorcycle ride across empty highway (near the end) will get you to the cable car station. Everything is huge, I mean the complex for bus parkings, etc. Paid ticket and up we go on the longest cable car ride I have ridden. Was afraid of height but easily overcame due to the length of time on the ride.  Went all the way to the French village, very European design and they had a lot European working there probably Eastern Europe as they dont speak much English. The buildings are no of the limestone, but they are painted that way. So all the effects are actually a fake. Nevertheless the weather is nice and cool. You start to feel this as you ascend no the cable car.  Took us about 2 hours to get to see everything needed to see. The long line to the alpine coaster wasted another one hour. The ride is only so-so nothing to ride home about, what a waste of time. And not to be racist or anything, there are way too many mainland Chinese tourist and they are so LOUDDDDD. Do not know why they need to shout everytime they speak. They dont respect your line. I am of Chinese descendants and realised all this, but with 10 of them behind you on your queue, that is something of a freak experience. This goes without saying Ba Na Hills is definately a tourist trap. I dont see many western tourist here.  Worse part is coming down from the hill. Tried to go back the same way we got here via the cable car stations. Apparently they have so many cable car stations that they change the hours without letting you know of their operation hours. No clear sign. Walked back and forth looking for a way out only to know the one we came on was not operational in the afternoon. And need to walk all the way back to an older station with older and smaller cable cars. There are 3 or 4 lines but only 2 are operational to bring people back down. The line down is so crowded had to wait 20 minutes. Then they bunch everyone one to max into a small cable car. Not a nice way to end the experience in Ba Na Hills.  Not recommended but if you have time to spend and money to spare. Come here.",
?곸뼱,Aug-17,2,Confusing I wasn't exactly sure what this place was before I went and I'm still scratching my head now that I've been. I honestly don't think I would have missed anything if we skipped this attraction.,
?곸뼱,Aug-17,2,"Cable cart nice, everything else not The cable cart offers great views but the theme park is bunch of french building copies and many restaurants, that's about all. I found the park to be boring (good for people who enjoy to spend the whole day taking photos) and the whole experience very lame and over priced. Not much action (like rides). There was a single ride which had a 2 plus hour line and it wasn't a nice ride anyway so I skipped.  I would still recommend doing this just because the views from cable cart are very nice and unique.",
?곸뼱,Aug-17,2,"Good laugh as a European I had a great laugh as a European seeing how parts of Europe have been rebuild here. Expect a blend of beerfestival in a French village, with Russian music. It was amusing, but thats it. Its only half done, very crowded and not that many things to do. Although fun for a few hours i would not visit again",
?곸뼱,Aug-17,2,"Cable Cars as far as the Eye Can See Well this is an interesting miss mash of a buddha, a flower garden, rides, street parades and games. A unique place that is up in the hills I am not sure if Ba Na Hills is supposed to be a very poor mans disneyland or what. It has a strong Russian influence. Overall it was pretty average with about half the games working, a lot of money for very little. Best Part: the view on the way up in the cable car. Worst Part: pretty much the lack of things working. Don't waste your money.",
?곸뼱,Jul-17,2,"AVOID Brasserie restaurant!!!! We were there this morning. This is a very nice daytrip for the whole family. The entry fee is 650,000 per person. The view is amazing from the cable car and from the top of the mountain. Lots of things to do up there: bobsleigh, visits some gardens, little french village, the fantasy land which has an indoor playground for kids( even small kids) , caroussel, it does looks like a Funfair but indoor and in fact its actually weird to think that this was build on such a huge mountain. The noise is terrible specially at the middle level. Its too much !!! I some point i just wanted to get out ! The kids had fun and that was the most important thing ! There is a little dinosaure museum with huge moving dinosaures. There is also a wax museum of celebrities (100,000 per person) There was a little live band on one of the place, very lovely music . Mainly expats working for the entertainment. (A lot of russian people.) Dont really understand why its there but yeah... its a mix of a lot of things on top of a beautiful mountain !!!  SO.... We went to a restaurant called BRASSERIE and it was the WORST dinning experience EVER !!!!! DO NOT GO THERE !!! Its big and busy but its such a MESS ! We arrived. No welcome. We go to a table. Its been cleaned. No one brings us a menu. We need to ask. No one come to take the order . So we need to call someone and place the order. 5 mins later another waitress comes and ask what we want to order. So we say that we ordered already. 2 mins after another one asks us if we want to order. Problem of communication ? The vietnamese people were not friendly at all. Except one guy. I dont have his name. The ladies were all rude or couldnt speak english !!!!( in such a touristic place? How is it possible)? There were a few russian girls working there. Dressed with traditional french dresses... they were nice and smiling and helping due to the lack of skills of the others. We ordered three dishes. Two dishes were served by the edge of the table. We didnt havr table mats ! Or cutelry. We had to ask !!!!  The third dish came 15 mins after we finished eating the two plates... We asked the bill and cancel the missing plate and sufdenly the last plate arrived. We accepted it but really we didnt want it! We were observing the other tables and the service was the same ... just bad This place is busy so they dont care about the quality ! They focus on the quantity They dont even have their tripadvisor page yet.too bad i would have rated it ZERO. The food was really average. Eatable but nothing GOOD. Just go somewhere else There was a hair in one of our plate. We showed that to the waitress who just dropped the plate in the kitchen and no one came to appologize... seriously ? Look at the picture ! They dont have desert in this restaurant. Its really not a brasserie its just a PIZZA PASTA Restaurant. One lady was the worst staff of this restaurant. She was walking taking orders and collecting the payment. Really impolite person. I asked to speak to a manager ( at the cashier, so it should be clear... ) but no one understood and were looking at each other. Did they say good bye to us ? Noooo of course !",
?곸뼱,Jun-17,2,"Good facilities but way too crowded The theme park is small and too crowded. The whole hill was packed with people. People merely sitting down on the floor at every corners. Quite a mess - at restaurants, toilets, even the church was so dirty with rubbish everywhere.",
?곸뼱,Jul-17,2,"Too busy! A massive tourist trap!! We went up through the cattle market of a cable car to find half of Vietnam at the top with us. Whilst the views were lovely and the flower gardens beautiful, it was hard to enjoy or get good photos when surrounded by so many people. The French wine was delicious though! And it was slightly surreal to see the French village right next to the pagodas.",
?곸뼱,Jul-17,1,DO NOT GO HERE Avoid at all costs. Worst theme park ever. Not sure you could even call it a theme park. Over crowded and full of rude queue pushing tourists with no respect of a line. The restaurants if you could call them that were a battle ground and they were serving slop. The cable car was nice. The toboggan was also the only decent ride. Do not waste your time.,
?곸뼱,Jun-17,2,"Not a must visit. Very Crowded. The only thing I enjoyed at Bana Hills was the chilly weather (it was 34 degrees in Danang) and the cable car ride up.  It would be cheaper for you to join a tour, if you really do the math. A tour would cost about VND 900k or less, it includes 2 way transportation, buffet lunch and cable car ride.  There are two parts to the cable-car ride. First, from the bottom to the 1st station (flower garden, wine chamber, restaurants etc), then from the 1st station to the 2nd station (fantasy park, buffet lunch).  It was not a very enjoyable experience for me. It was extremely crowded!!! I think it was school holidays in vietnam?  It also started raining halfway when I went up, I spent most of the time hiding under a shelter. The 3 stories indoor fantasy park was not impressive at all, mainly because the queue was such a turn off. People were cutting queue/squeezing and stuff. They had like a whole floor of arcade games(for free), but most of them were faulty. They would occasionally have performance indoor and outdoor by a bunch of foreigners (white people).  Honestly, nothing special. Just a good place for people to take selfies/pictures lol.",
?곸뼱,Jun-17,1,"Super bad queue management and rude staff!! This place is extremely not for young children. If you are traveling with baby stroller, make sure you go with a strong man. Be ready to lift up the stroller all the time as there is NO elevators. There is a lot of staircases and escalators. Ba Na Hills management needs to know that using baby stroller on escalator can be dangerous. The amusement park at the peak has many rides for young toddlers. I was traveling with a 14 months and 3 years old. My 3 years old loved the rides. But again, this place is not huge and yet not kids friendly. Talking about the queue for cable car, the staffs were extremely rude and they DONT care about young children at all. They pushed you, yelled at you, tried their best to make your trip as unenjoyable as they could. No more next time Ba Na Hill. Again, this place is not convenient for family with young children. Or I suggest you to carry your kid the whole day without bringing a stroller. Food - the lunch buffet was very decent. As it is included in my tour, I had no choice. But it was quite poor.",
?곸뼱,Jun-17,1,"Such a tourist trap I booked the tour instead of going to Ba Na by myself since when the math works out, tour is way cheaper. I know beforehand it is a tourist trap but Ba Na is one of those places that you need to go see it just so you can officially say it is a tourist trap. It was so crowded and it was only Thursday. I wasn't into taking pictures and selfies of pretty places, therefore, it wasn't a place for me. The entertainment park is pretty cool. If you would like to check out Ba Na, I would recommend to do the tour, costs about 870k, but the cable car ticket already costs 650k. Buffet lunch is included in the tour, otherwise it will cost 200k. Bus will pick you up from your hotel, otherwise, taxi or motorbike taxi from downtown to Ba Na entrance will be quite pricey.",
?곸뼱,Jun-17,1,"A very bad experience Not elderly friendly at all, steps all over the place. Not tourist friendly, staff cannot speak English. No English maps in the whole place.",
?곸뼱,Jun-17,1,"Total Chaos ...Not worth the trip This is my 3rd visit where hopes are up as the last 2 ones are terrible but given the need to entertain kids, it was included in the itinerary. Nothing has changed in the 2 years since i first came.it doesnt matter whether weekday or weekend Mangement hasnt given a thoight on how to address the queue nor the upkeep of the place",
?곸뼱,May-17,2,"Cable car great The ride up and down is stunning. I'm guessing the owners thought...'right we've got them up there so what to lay on'... must best be described as Harry Potter on steroids, thousands of people indulging their narcissism with billions of selfies. You simply can't move for the selfie stick. However we had much fun in the wax museum. Possibly the best 100,000 ding dongs I've spent.",
?곸뼱,Apr-17,1,"The cable car-yes, the destination -NO What a waste of time. Ba Na Hills is a vietnamese Disneyland, but without the great attractions. Sold as a French village in the hills it is a cheap amusement park where you are stuck buying whatever they want to sell you, food, drinks etc, as they own the lot. Dont waste your time. You cant ride the cable car without paying the entry fee.",
?곸뼱,May-17,2,Common cable car I dont understand why this is famous. This was common style cable car and there was no clear direction with regards to 3 kinds of cable car access availability. We was very confused to find our direction.,
?곸뼱,May-17,2,Very crowded It was uncomfortable expereance because of extremely crowded people and hot weather. This is a kind of Disney world including cable car. Some European style buildings were mostly expensive shops but there was no products worth to buy. Restaurants were not much and serving wad extremely late. Russian bbq restaurant was rude and dirty. I had to wait 40 minutes to be served my food ordered. I will not visit here again if I will visit Danang again.,
?곸뼱,Apr-17,2,"Very Odd Experience We visited Ba Na Hills unexpectedly as we arrived in Vietnam too early to check in to our hotel so our tour guide took us here. I wouldn't say it was a bad experience, just very odd... a bit like Disneyland had decided to upgrade all their sets and gave Ba Na Hills the old stuff. After queuing for a long time we finally boarded the cable car and I must admit the ride up is excellent but the fun stops there... when you get to the top and its a weird fake french village and all the buildings are empty... literally nothing and noone in them at all. You then have a random arcade with rides for the kids in the middle of 'french village' - it was free though to be fair. There are a lot of steps up to some quite nice temples but i would say that you can see better ones elsewhere. All in all a very odd experience that I never want to relive.",
?곸뼱,Apr-17,2,wouldn't bother!! the cable car is the highlight! it's an 18 minute ride into the clouds so i would say that the location of this french faux village is exceptional but it stops there!! for asian people who have not visited europe i can understand the attraction along with the cooler temps! the tackiest feature is blaring music over the PA system! on another level cheap french songs!! it ruined any pleasant experience!! when you first arrive they were playing Queen to a fountain need i say more??,
?곸뼱,Apr-17,1,"So strange This is the weirdest place I have ever been. Our lunch at Le Jardin was possibly one of the worst meals I've ever had the misfortune of eating. Cable car ride was the best part. Despite it being so strange and confusing, it will certainly be a travel tale!",
?곸뼱,Mar-17,2,"BAD Service charge is too expensive. I encountered a quite frightening incident when the cable stopped abruptly. My cabin swayed and made us dizzy. The price on the restaurant is too expensive. Commemorative souvenirs are not clear. I will not turn back, never.",
?곸뼱,Mar-17,1,"Never again After you pay the excessive price for the cable car (600,000 VND per person) and eventually make it to the top there's nothing... Just some artificial French-style buildings with all the authenticity of Euro Disney. You can see everything within about 30 minutes. Nothing is included in the cable car price, everything is extra.  Most of the site is under construction which spoils any views there may have been. The entertainment was some blonde women dancing - badly, to inappropriate music.  We ate in the restaurant at the Mercure hotel - seemed the least-bad of the many overpriced food options (mostly Italian food and pizza for some reason) - the food was at least Vietnamese but expensive and mediocre.  I can see how this place might appeal to Asian tourists (locals cannot afford to visit) who have never visited Europe and/or have never seen a blonde woman in the flesh, but for us it was not worth the trip from Da Nang, the long cable car ride or the excessive cost.",
?곸뼱,Mar-17,1,"Ahhhhhahaha Terrible construction maybe wonderful for local peoples, expensive ticket and poor thinks there not that I'm expected",
?곸뼱,Mar-17,2,"Beautiful place; lousy golf conditions Well over an hour's drive from Danang, the greens of this so-called ""latest and greatest"" golf course are, for whatever reason, in terrible condition.  Too bad management has chosen to open the course rather than wait for 95% quality. I'd never go back.",
?곸뼱,Feb-17,1,"Poor experience As an experienced globetrotter, this place is really overly artificially altered. I wish they had kept it the way it was with just the cable cars for easier access. The French Village and the Fantasy park are simply too contrived and cheesy. The church's interior was not even built with real stone! It's made out of some kind of concrete and with paint to make it look like weathered stone! Not really worth the effort and time to visit.",
?곸뼱,Jan-17,2,"Come to Vietnam for fake European remake? We were with family from Vietnam that wanted to visit Ba Na hills what a mistake. first of all do check the weather forecast, on the day we wnet it was already raining and when we got to the top of the mountain, it was a full scale wind and rain storm. Of course the staff was not going to tell you that when you buy the tickets and the rain parkas they were selling too. .marked up of course. Everything was over priced and was expected very ""cheesy"".",
?곸뼱,Feb-17,2,"Cable car ride is awesome on a clear day but give the rest a miss!! We did a tour to Ba Na Hills which certainly did not describe a ""fake"" french village and wax museum and kids games!! Not a day out in the countryside travelling through local villages like we thought. We went on the day after Lunar New Years day and it was really busy but at least it was clear. Don't get me wrong the cable car ride and view is awesome but unless you are into theme park types of amusements and non genuine buildings it is really not somewhere I would recommend for adults. Obviously kids will enjoy it and it looks like the place will eventually have a full scale theme park nearby. The gardens are quite nice, the ""french"" wine cellar only sells cheap South Australian cask wine there is nothing local about the wine here!! Everything is on quite a steep hill so even though some of the views are great when it is clear there are quite steep pathways and lots and lots of steps so not ideal for the elderly or those who find steps a challenge. This is one place in Vietnam where we will not be back. Do the cable car up and back but don't stay!!",
?곸뼱,Feb-17,1,"Disappointment You go through the jungle, beautiful cascades with a telepheric and then you arrive to the top where is standing a fake medieval French city. There you find only a lot of fake commerces (a pizzeria called Brasserie, a cinema/bakery selling souvenirs, wine shop selling clothes...). The food is poor quality and expensive. The group of dancers wearing Renaissance clothes are dancing modern song (too loud!) with a group of musicians (good by the way, but play only few songs) all coming from Russia. What a waste to have destroyed a so beautiful natural site for this!!!",
?곸뼱,Feb-17,1,"Unlucky boy ! I'm now in Bana hills , it's really bad in rainy days, not recommended at all in rainy days believe me u will regret as I'm regretting now! Wasting money and time...",
?곸뼱,Jan-17,2,"Far below expectation Visiting Ba Na Hills is very weather-dependent as you could barely enjoy exploring the European-style resort amid rain and fog. The admission fee, VND 600,000 for an adult, is not cheap compared to the CPI in the country. The resort has an indoor amusement park which could allow you to spend 2 hours to play around. The restaurants here, as many travelers had said, are unreasonably priced for the reason of 5% VAT and 10 % service charge being applied to the bill. But, I didn't see any service worth 10% service charge as my glass was kept empty after I paid the bill.  To be fair, it should have been a good attraction in Da Nang experiencing the French colonial architecture if the weather allows.  I don't recommend travelers to come to this place but save the money on the other attractions and restaurants to explore more local taste of Vietnamese culture.",
?곸뼱,Jan-17,2,"Great cable cars. We booked a tour to the ba na hills. Our guide took us to the mountains. First we rode the cable cars for 15 minutes with another family then we rode another one for 3 minutes. The view was stunning. There were streams and brooks and pools of water. Also high trees and huge ferns. If you like cable car rides and mountain views this is the place for you. Then we went to the park to ride the rides. The rides were all indoors and were not as great as we expected--video games, gun shooting games and such. The best ride, in our option was a ride that spun around and went up and down dangerously. It was great but short and it didn't go too high. We wanted to go the flower garden but it was too rainy and misty (we suspect it is this rainy every winter) and after the rides and the buffet (big but not many foods to choose from.) we went home riding the 15 minute cable car. It wasn't as great as we expected.",
?곸뼱,Jan-17,2,"a LOT of money for such a mediocre day So to start off it's 600,000d per person. This gets you the cable car, admission to 2/3's of the park and a free buffet lunch. The cable car goes about half way up. Where you straight away pay an additional 70,000d per person to go on the funicular up to a flower garden, that includes a maze, a big Buddha and a wine cellar. That area can be done in 1 hour. funicular back down and 2nd cable car to the top. Quite a old town french feel to the castles which are quite cool to see, however thats it. You then have your buffet which is Vietnamese style, which i usually enjoy however you could tell the food has been sat there for a long period. We headed to the wax works which was a further 100,000d per person, quite a poor representation of most celebrities, they have about 30 in total and most rubbish. Johnny Depp is especially bad. The amusements are where you will spend your remaining time, as there is nothing to do up top other than eat in a few cafes. Then head back down in a cable car straight to the bottom. Could be enjoyable if you're older or really easily entertained. But be advised its 770,000d per person in total, and Vietnam has a lot better parks to offer north or south of here.",
?곸뼱,Dec-16,2,"Ba Na mountains Let me get straight to the point and say that Ba Na mountain was quite a let down. The entry prices are very expensive compared to other recreational activities in Da Nang and you have to pay seperately for almost any activity(cable car, train). The buddhist temples on top of the mountain were really pretty though and the arcade was quite enjoyable.",
?곸뼱,Nov-16,2,"I can't see anything, I'm cold and wet. Are we having fun yet ? OK, I kind of get why people would want to ascend a mountain and get away from the heat of the plains BUT !  When this place is shrouded in cloud it's no fun at all and the only place to hide is the tacky amusement centre so I strongly recommend you check the weather forecast first before travelling all the way to Ba Na Hills.",
?곸뼱,Nov-16,1,Don't waste your time Don't waste your time. Total tourist trap. Poor replication of a mini Disneyland. Buffet offered by Ba Na Hill tour company was terrible with people lined up four deep fighting to get to the food.,
?곸뼱,Nov-16,1,"A Vietnamese billionaires version of Disneyland... If you have every been to Disney land, then you can pass on the 600,000 Dong is costs to go here.  Aside from being the longest continuous cable car in the world, (a record set in 2009), there is really nothing to see here.  If you are lucky and have great weather the view can be special, but if the weather is raining before you get in the cable car the top of the mountain will be miserable, slippery, windy, cold and wet.  Wait for a sunny day if you must go and don't forget your rain gear just in case.",
?곸뼱,Jul-16,2,"The cable car was the only saving grace The cable car had magnificent views but we made the mistake of staying overnight here. If you have to come, just stay for the day - you could really punch out all that is to know of this place in a day. It is mock ""medieval"" village charm wears off 3 minutes after you alight from the cable car. As with most of Vietnam though, the staff were amazing and helpful and they made our side trip enjoyable.",
?곸뼱,Oct-16,2,"Was wet & cloudy with ordinary amusement park We went on our last day and straight to airport afterwards, so that worked well. We didn't get hot and sweaty. Gondola was great - but was wet and cloudy so views weren't great. We didn't see much at the top because of rain. Looked ok, just a weird having a French replica village on the mountain. No one could tell me where the outdoor roller coaster was, couldn't find it (was probably shut with weather anyway). Russian outdoor restaurant had good BBQ. Rides were ordinary but kids amused themselves - it's a big indoor amusement park 3 or 4 floors. I'd hate to be there when it's busy! Allow enough time to get down queue at end of the day. We had to queue for 45min and it looked like no one was there!",
?곸뼱,Oct-16,2,"Beautiful scenery spoilt by the kitsch theme park at the top Visited Ba Na Hills on a wet and foggy day. Though the rain was disappointing, it was actually not the worst thing about our visit. The cable-car ride was spectacular, despite the rain and fog, we were still able to get a feel for the majestic beauty of the mountain. The cable-car ride takes roughly 15 or 20 minutes and is broken up into two separate trips up, and a single uninterrupted return trip. Unfortunately, this was the best part of our visit. We took refuge in the wine cellar which was restored, but not to it's former glory. As with most of the man made attractions on Ba Na, it was cheesy and unauthentic. The garden was nice and on a clear day, I could imagine this would offer the most spectacular views. From there, we made it to the summit for lunch along with what looked like every other tourist on mountain. The summit is where, for some reason, someone felt it necessary to build a kitch replica of a European town out of plastic. A buffet was served in large hall where staff would periodically refresh the toughs of food. We felt very much like cattle. During lunch, the power went out twice. To complete the experience, we visited the fantasy fun park. Given that it was raining outside, we didn't mind this so much. Our daughter was had fun running the lower level toddler area. Unfortunately, they only allow one adult into the area per child, so my wife had to wait outside this toddler area by herself. My advice, pick a clear day, ride the cable-cars and go home.",
?곸뼱,Oct-16,2,Nothing special really... 5km cable car world longest... Honestly... Nothing really special and not worth to go... Don't waste your time.,
?곸뼱,Oct-16,2,All new built and over priced. If u wanna c some historical stuff... Don't go there. All are rebuilt in the last couple of years. Is really not much there to c and definitely not worth the price,
?곸뼱,Sep-16,2,"Wouldn't bother A French inspired, recently constucted, tacky and over priced location. The cable car was the only thing worth doing there, the rest reeked of a trashy imitation village of Europe.",
?곸뼱,Sep-16,2,"Pickpockets galore - watch out! Lots and lots of pickpockets, be very wary, they target foreigners in groups. If it wasn't for that the place is nice and the gardens are lovely.",
?곸뼱,Aug-16,2,"Very disappointing Ba Na Hills is a disappointing trip for Western tourists. The cable car element is good, but it takes you to a rather strange fake French styled village with a very unimpressive amusement park. I would not recommend this trip.",
?곸뼱,Aug-16,2,"Expensive waste of time ! Other than the cable car and views, there is nothing positive to say about this place. I have seen some compare it to disney. It is NOT disney or have any of the rides that Disney has.  There are a number of imitation French buildings and numerous restaurants offering porr food and service.  It's about 45 mins from centre of Danang and 70 mins from Hoi An.  i didn't witness the queues but it was geared up for some very long queues with many barriers in place to marshal people in queues, especially for the cable car.  Very poor value.",
?곸뼱,Aug-16,1,Fake French village on a hill?! Where to start?! All in all a complete desaster. Very overpriced (600.000 VND p.P.) copy of Paris's Disneyland...  Initially we thought we would get to see an old Vietnamese Village - haha... :( But didn't do our research very well. Since we ended up in some crazy fake world packed with chinese tourists groups who obviously enjoyed themselves. Taking selfies infront of fake French buildings like Notre Dam. Just ridiculous.  We skipped the amusement park in the underground and just went straight back down.  However cable ride was quite ok as we had a good view.  Only recommendable for Chinese tourist groups... Don't waste your time!,
?곸뼱,Sep-15,1,Tourist trap A few things to see. Nice cable car ride. Generally not much exciting here. Careful using ATM's. There was one rigged here which stole my card number. Within days my card was being used simultaneously in 12 places throughout Vietnam!! This is a dangerous scam in many countries now. Check that you only use BANK ATMS at banks and not those at convenience locations such as resorts. Check the card entry slot to make sure it is no a 'mock-up' or artificial overlay.,
?곸뼱,Aug-16,2,"Hot box Man, Vietnam is a hot place , so staying inside a cable car for 20mins with a bunch of Chinese tourists is the pits! Recommend bring water and a hand fan to keep you cool. Views are pretty cool though",
?곸뼱,Jul-16,2,"Too touristy and crowded, but a nice view Went late morning on a week day. If you absolutely hate the heat and humidity of Danang, the top of the mountains offer a nice cool reprieve. The view was beautiful going up the cable car, but was NOT worth the admission price. The resort at the top is highly over rated and solely for tourists (minimal historical or cultural value, spent our hour up there dodging the heaps of tourists taking photos).",
?곸뼱,Aug-15,2,A real shame To have transformed this serene mountain top resort into the circus it is now. Only worth it for the ride up the cable car.,
?곸뼱,Jul-16,2,"The cable car is the only decent thing about ba na hills Don't waste your time or money here. Yes the cable car is good but the people here are the rudest I've met in the world. We couldn't get a drink as the young girl wouldn't serve us but kept serving people around us. The patrons of this place are so rude, they push and shove you, there wasn't too many western people there so perhaps they don't want us there. Don't waste your time it's awful",
?곸뼱,Jun-16,2,"The place is beautiful, but so noisy and unpolied It was one of our planned must see place regardless of other bad comment. We regretted now with that decision. The best part for us is the cable ride. It is a longest single-cable in the world. However, it was so crowded and noisy. You would expect a French style village on the hill will give a peaceful quiet space. It is an opposite, people talking so loud, pushing, and so disordering.  Disappointed and sigh!  Jack",
?곸뼱,Jun-16,2,Once is enough Spent a lot of time waiting and queuing for the cable car up to Ba Na hill. Way too crowded and noisy. Spoiled the tranquility of the hill. Will not visit again.,
?곸뼱,Jun-16,1,"Overloaded My family decided to go there because the place is very well -known, Thoroughly It was very good advertising, But It would not what we are expecting, too crowded, noisy, difficult to get a little space, long queue waiting people, NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL",
?곸뼱,Jun-16,1,"Boring, unprofessional service! It was a disaster for us! 2 hours queuing and waiting to board on cable car, and once we left the cable station, thousands people was flooding Ba Na. Such a terrible experience for my family. So tired! We will never ever go back Ba Na Hills!!!!",
?곸뼱,May-16,1,"Overpriced, Long Lines, lots of people, but amazing view We went here to ride the cable car and see the flower garden. The problem is to ride the cable car you have to buy admission to the amusement park which is around $30us plus another cheap ticket for the train to the flower garden. Anyway the flower garden was nice, the cable car was not impressive. It's basically same thing as taking a gondola at vail or Breckinridge skiing except people treat it as an attraction here and transportation at a ski resort. We did venture to the top where the amusement park is just because we already paid for it. Walked around for 15 minutes and headed for the gate. It was jam packed, and very loud music was playing. I could see it being fun for small children to make a day out of but not so much for adults.",
?곸뼱,May-16,2,VERY crowded and too turisty! Went there on a tour which was a waste of money and time. It's always slower going in a big group and the guide didn't really tell anything about the place or showed us around.  I went there on a Sunday - DON'T do it!! It was super crowded and most asian people are really pushy. Waited in line for 90 min. to get on the cable cars to go up!  The mountain is beautiful but it's very commercial which is a shame.  Would not recommend!,
?곸뼱,May-16,1,"If you want to waste your time, pls go there It is a kind of imitation village. If you want to spend your time and money without value for some lunch in fake europe, why not. If you are normal, dont go there",
?곸뼱,May-16,2,"Overpriced and super touristy We went there because my boyfriend though it could be fun but he also admitted we should have done more research before. It is the world's highest and longest cable car line and I can't remember the prices I've paid for this service in Europe before but I think this is an expensive one (600.000d). Anyway, it's a very nice journey up to the village so if you are not on a low budget you should give it a try. The old town could be nice, but they just began to rebuilt it I guess and they are turning it to a very fancy, freak adult disneyland. There are some nice walks around there though but if I will think about this trip in future, all of the negative labels which tourism means for me will come to mind.",
?곸뼱,Apr-16,2,"It's worth a try... For those who have never visit it, yes try it once. Just couple of french style buildings and outdated rides...The park itself was nothing too special, however, the ride up there was extraordinary.",
?곸뼱,Jul-15,1,Meh Lovely views on the cart up. but when there you are greeted by fake old buildings and plastic flowers. One of the worst places to visit in Da Nang.,
?곸뼱,Jan-16,1,"BOYCOTT BA NA HILLS - Double Standards When will this country learn...and mature as a tourist destination? There should be no local and tourist price! Full stop! There should be an entrance fee for adult and children and people of different nationalities, race or skin colour should not be penalized! Shame on you Ba Na Hills.",
?곸뼱,Mar-16,1,very nice place and beautiful to visit beautiful place if i have time i will visit here again when u were there it seam like you are in a novel castle they are nice decorated,
?곸뼱,Feb-16,2,"Tourist trap, fake village, only the cable car ride is worth it The cable car, one of the highest/longest in the world, it very nice. However, after that, things go downhill quite rapidly. The village is a fake French village, including fake castles etc. And a gallery with games (videogames, rides etc). This is not really Vietnamese, but just a (badly) themed amusement park. Would not recommend it to be honest.  It's a bit too touristy and too kitschy.",
?곸뼱,Feb-16,2,"Unorganised Chaos I stayed at a Ba Na Hills resort in February and encountered many problems. I wrote to customer service on my return but as no bothered to respond I am posting for advice?? I completed the web site on line booking form but when no one contacted me I sent a direct email. Again no one replied so we then called directly to the sales manager She then sent details of available rooms and rates and I requested a standard king room rate My credit card was charged twice this amount and when I queried this she had booked us a superior room without checking with me as now due to slow reply there was no double standard available I had requested. She said a standard twin room would be booked with the beds pulled together. I had to several emails/calls to resolve this and felt poor communication many times. On arrival we waited in the car park to be collected with our heavy bags but no one came and had to walk to reception desk 1. After checking in at the ground reception we went up the lift to reception number 2, then up another lift to the cable car but had to return to reception no 2 as they didn?셳 inform us we had to purchase the lift pass beforehand. I was also not able to charge this to my room booking. We then arrived at the resort and had to deal with 2 more different reception desks before finally getting a room key. In the room the twin beds had not been moved together. The TV remote did not work. There was no English TV channels. Wi-Fi kept logging me out and was poor signal when it did log in. Although this is only 3 star I would have expected a cleaner, better shower. The swimming pool, as stated in the sales manager?셲 email was not yet open. At dinner that evening we couldn?셳 charge to the room even though this all part of one resort. I appreciate this was during Lunar holidays but at breakfast there was a shortage of food and cutlery. On our departure we asked for our bags to be delivered to ground reception so we could visit De bay station. After much confusion we were assured they would be waiting for us at ground level. This did not happen and we had to wait for them to carried down by golf cart. Making us late for planned departure.  The resort has much potential and great landscaping but I will not be recommending Ba Na Hills in its present state. It may be less hassle if you travel with a tour company but we are independent travellers not sheep, Or just go for the day trip.",
?곸뼱,Feb-16,2,Not worth for money I was impressed by marvelous views and its weaty but sooner desperate its poor quality and overpriced.,
?곸뼱,Feb-16,2,"The only things worth this trip is the cable car The cable car is the only and man wow attraction here, and fro there on theres only disappointment. This place may be a really hit for the local because they rarely attend other attractions outside Vietnam. But if u r a tourist coming here I guarantee you will get disappointed when arriving on the top of the hill. The french architecture is quite nice but thats all. The food is really overprice (Im saying soo Even im from norway and we all know how much dinner out cost in norway ) its okay that food is overpriced sometimes if its good but up here in Ba Na, the food is bad and looks really undelicated and some what a bit dry and maybe expired. ? I dont know but recommend you to save your money for going other places instead... if u r not really keen on cable cars",
?곸뼱,Apr-15,1,"Not a place you go to eat. View good, food bad. The restaurant is not good at all. Service is even worse. Not a place you go to enjoy dinner or lunch but the view is beautiful.",
?곸뼱,Jan-16,2,"If you want authentic, this ain't for you. Shame to put such an ugly thing in a beautiful place. If you're on vacation with family especially kids, and want an afternoon of safe clean fun, then this is the spot for you.  The ride up the tram was wonderful, you get to see all the beautiful nature and mountains. But, if you're a nature enthusiast, thats where the fun ends. Bana is a very kitschy place where everything is fake. Know what you're getting into. If you're from the states, its basically a renaissance festival meets county fair stuck ontop a mountain.  Pros: Nature, clean, go see the temple, family friendly, tram ride Cons: Fake, tourist-trappy, costs a pretty penny to get to and get from  OH, one last thing. If you want a decent themepark that doesn't cost you millions, hit up the Asia Park in Danang. Its equally as clean, family friendly, and rides are bigger and more fun and its more affordable for larger groups.",
?곸뼱,Jan-16,2,"Not an interesting place. If you are a foreigner, you may not want to come this hill. It lacks original characteristic. Full of ugly man-made stuff, and its building is such a disaster. They create a ""European French"" style just to attract the tourist. This place is so much better in the past without the touch of human beings.",
?곸뼱,Jan-16,2,"Artificial 5 stars for the view. As everyone has mentioned, the views on the cable car is wonderful. The rest is just plain weird weird WEIRD! What's the purpose of an artificial French town? Why is there a GAME ARCADE up on a beautiful mountain ?",
?곸뼱,Dec-15,2,"Don't go if you've been to Europe The trip in the cable car it self is ok as you can see the nice jungle below you, butas soon as you arrive at a theme park you just wanna go home again. French looking buildings (really look fake) and some other silly stuff. 550.000 VMD is too much for this trip - but maybe we Europeans are spoiled with greater cable cars in The Alps.",
?곸뼱,Dec-15,2,"No nature up there When it comes to be called ""hills"", we thought it was a trip get us back to nature with breathtaking sunset, and fresh air, and outdoor camping. But no, tall buildings and resorts and entertainment center were built. Streets were covered with asphalt. We did not even have a chance to get into the jungle to see waterfall, i also doubt there is no animal that can survive whose habitats are used to build more facilities. We got there around 11am and were so disappointed, so left after 4 hours walking around to find if there was anything to visit.",

?곸뼱,Nov-15,1,"Go on a really really good weather. I've wasted 1,000,000 VND or roughly 65 AUD. Going up the cable car you could see nothing because of the fog. Upon reaching the top you could see nothing because of the fog. It's cold, & windy.  I wanted to take photos about & around because it's high up but....  I stayed in the amusement centre to keep warm. I attempted to go & explore the outside but just a few metres you could not see the buildings. I'm back inside the amusement centre having coffee & waiting for my for guide & lunch.  I tried to see the positive side of this experience but it's just dampened. It's partly my fault as I relied on Hoi An weather which was good the previous couple of days.  Note to myself.... listen to other travellers' advice. Skip Central Vietnam at this time of the year.  If you're here do not go!",
?곸뼱,Nov-15,1,"Only good thing was the cable car I find it so hard to describe this place. Visited in November, was excited as I'd never been on a cable car before, but I have to say that's the only thing I enjoyed. The views were amazing. Most things were closed at the top or under renovation. Couldn't grab a coffee to go unless we went into a restaurant to eat. The 'free', amusement arcade compared to European standards is a bit of a joke. Although I did relive my youth a bit on the bumper cars. For what it is, it's too expensive, I would have gladly came straight back down after going up, only for we weren't getting collected for a few hours after.",
?곸뼱,Oct-15,2,"A fake world created to rip you off The cable car ride up the hill is very nice and probably the best reason to come to Ba Na Hills in the first place.  The rest of site looks a lot more impressive online than in real life. Half of the site is still under construction. You'll hear construction noise everywhere.  The entrance fee is pretty high (550000 VND), but does not include everything. They try to make you pay again for several attractions, e.g. the flower garden and the wax museum. If you go here, bring your own food. The few restaurants and cafes make use of their monopoly and charge you exorbitant prices.",
?곸뼱,Oct-15,1,"Awful, commercialized. We went to Ba Na in search of trekking and were horribly disappointed. The information on TA wasn't conclusive so we risked it and paid the price.

I dont found the view is the pros as its too high so you are surrounded by fog. Why go to France's ancient town in Vietnam? And the food is really expensive. I would come back in the next 5 years.",
?곸뼱,Aug-15,2,"So disappointed! I was said it is a French village... maybe, but of the Middle Age!... A bad copy like Asian can do! A French village, with a Vietnamese hotel and a Russian restaurant!... So typical French, right? Do you really need to spend USD100 for 2 people to go there and have nothing else to do than to visit a poor level wax museum?... I really don't think so! One more failure in the local tourism industry!",
?곸뼱,Sep-15,1,"Wow this sucks They are still doing construction, the only good thing is the cable car ride.  The bad things  Staffs unable to comprehend service. (Waited in line to buy a soda, but constantly go cut in front of by locals and staff did nothing until i had to yell)  People just taking pictures of nothing blocking pathways.  Most rides are not runing.  Experience 2 out of 10 (due to cable car ride)",
?곸뼱,Sep-15,2,"good views; bizarre experience This is a novelty trip build around a cable car ride.  The positive: the ride is smooth, the car stations clean and the views are nice. Not spectacular but green and pleasant. The set-up is expensive but efficient - but be aware the cable cars do have piped piano covers of Lionel Ritchie, Elton John etc so you have to hope the car doesn't get stuck. The not-yet-completed mock- French Norman village at the summit is not good though. The presumably unintended irony is that the eateries are not French but Balkan, U.S. (Terrible pizza or burger - ""gourmet combo"") or Asian food hall-style fast food variations.",
?곸뼱,Aug-15,1,"A day from hell Please do not visit here if the weather is forecast to be bad. We got caught on the cable car in the eye of a thunder and lightning storm yesterday. It rates at the most horrific day of our lives. The children have not recovered emotionally and keep getting upset. The lightning was metres from our car, the thunder deafening. The car rocked. There was no way up or down, the forest floor was 150 metres below us. No announcements were made to reassure us. Of the 4 other people in the car, 2 were sick. It took an hour to get through it...it was a sustained horrific experience that will leave scars. However if no storm is forecast I would have rated it a 3",
?곸뼱,Jun-15,2,Pricey and limited After our long ride to get here we were flabbergasted at how expensive it was. The theme park was very limited with long queues to see or do anything. The scenery on the cablecar ride up/down was very nice. Vietnam's answer to Disneyland it is not.,
?곸뼱,Jul-15,2,"Do not waste your money We went here as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids aged 4 years and 18 months).  The cable car ride was nice, nothing anymore special than any other cable car I've been on - just that the ride went a little longer. The kids enjoyed the amusement park - I thought it was rubbish. Quite a few rides/amusements weren't operating. The play area for little kids needs cleaner flooring, it just felt disgusting,  We had the buffet lunch and the poor belly was very nice, the rest was as you'd expect at a buffet. We had a number of people filming us with their phones whilst we ate....which was just weird.  The toilets were very clean which is always a bonus when you have little kids.  We didn't go to the wax museum as we couldn't be bothered paying extra to go in.  We didn't go to the gardens either.  Overall the husband and kids gave it a 6/10.  I'd give it a 2/10 - 1 point for the pork belly and another for the clean toilets.",
?곸뼱,Jul-15,2,Not worth it! In went there with my two teenage kids and this place was quite disappointing. Very limited attractions and a lot of noise everywhere (even inside the cable car so we could not enjoy the jungle sounds from the forrest). Might be ok for small kids but still very limited attractions (3-5 maybe). This place has more restaurants than attractions. For Europeans like us we were not impressed by the French looking buildings - it looked very fake. The only thing we enjoyed was the view towards the ocean and the cable car trip over the forrest/mountains. But clearly not worth 550.000 VND/person. We rather prefer the French Alps or Euro Disney.,
?곸뼱,Jul-15,1,"Utterly horrible Full of chinese people who don't understand the concept of queueing. There were no bananas, very disappointing. Also the tigers were not on display.",
?곸뼱,Jul-15,1,"Avoid for now I will advise to hold off on this for now due to the absolute mess of the ticketing and admittance process. Pushing, shoving, screaming, crying, people cutting in line, hot, long wait and no order. You're better off going to the beach. Wait for others to comment on improved admittance before trying this, esp if you don't speak Vietnamese. I had a Vietnamese speaker with me and it was still complete chaos understanding what was going on.",
?곸뼱,Jul-15,1,"What a letdown The wait to enter the cable car took around 75 minutes due to the pressure of the crowd and the inability of the organisers to keep thiings moving. Once at the top, we enjoyed our stay immensely until a storm that stopped the cable cars revealed a complete lack of organisational and communicative skills of the resort staff. No information was made available to our tour guide and the line did not move for more than 90 minutes although the Vietnamese, in typical Vietnamese fashion refused to stop pressing forward. The whole thing would have been extremely dangerous in the event that an emergency had caused crowd panic. It was an extremely disappointing end to what had been a lovely stay at the top. Moral of the story is to check the weather before you go to Ba Na Hills.",
?곸뼱,Jul-15,2,"Tacky overcrowded tourist trap with a few merits Let me call this as it is: Ba Na hills is a tacky tourist trap designed to siphon tourist dollars. And yet these two demographic groups of tourist will still come in huge numbers: (1) Chinese tourists who just want to take selfies or tour group photos in front of artificial creations. (2) Middle and upper class locals trying to escape the summer heat.  It was terribly crowded when we were there with thousands everywhere trying to get into the cable car. It did not help that many Vietnamese children think there's nothing wrong with pushing others or stepping on other's toes with their parents not reprimanding them.  While the cable car ride was long, the scenery is not as special as in countries like China. The buffet there was the worst I had eaten in my life. The wax museum looks like it was made by high school kids. The temple looked tacky and another sign of religious serenity was absent. The gardens were full of fake structures and the theme park was noisy.  It was not a total loss though. The Cathedral was really beautiful and I liked the 3D, 4D, 5D shows.  For the tourists looking for authenticity and the real Vietnam, skip this. If you like joining noisy tour groups, then this is for you.",
?곸뼱,Jul-15,2,"queuing and queuing on tour the good location assume park on the peak of mountain in 1500m high. weather is cool in the day. but it's not four seasons a day like announcement. Staff service is not good, maybe too crowded makes them nervous and had some bad respond to customers. no smile, no warmly, no tender.. and so on. Big problem is the transportation system. the ability of transportation now can't serve for capacity of assume park. the investigation of transportation not enough for capacity, that's the reason why queuing is the bad impressed when spending time here and make alot of waste time. Game center is big and it's only attraction for customers. nothing more. buffet noon quite so so, not delicious, some guests smoke in the inside restaurant and no staff warning! it's terrible. in trust, I never come back until the transportation in assume improving.",
?곸뼱,Jun-15,1,"10% Disneyland; 90% Disappointing Had we known that it costs 550,000 VND (~US$25) PER PERSON and then waiting in the queue for 45 minutes just to get onthe gondola to the almost-top (false summit)--the only way in--we might've done something else that day.  Upon arrival at the almost-top, we endured a pushy me-first queue for another 25 minutes to ride to the summit. There we found a faux-Disney ""French chateau"" whose bowels hold two floors of arcade games and a couple ""thrill"" rides.  The incline railroad to the Temple costs a bit and is probably the only individual feature in the whole shebang worth it's cost.  Your day is better spent locked in your hotel room... or almost anywhere else.",
?곸뼱,Jun-15,2,"Long queue, no map, confusing schedule I believe it had to do with Vietnamese children having school holiday when we were there. The queue was super long even on a weekday. I think we queued for 1.5 hours before we got into the cable car. In the summer heat it was very uncomfortable. The cable car schedule in the official website is difficult to understand. There seems to be a few stations. According to the website, there's also a Suoi Mo to Ba Na route but following the queue, all we did was the cable car ride from Toc Tien Station (at the end of a few escalator rides) to Indochine Station. One way lasted 15 minutes. After visiting, I'm still none the wiser about whether there's indeed a Bana Station, or whether we had missed anything. A map and a time table given with the purchase of the ticket will be useful.  We happened to be directed to an open-air cable car. It was great because as we ascended we could feel the cooler air. The amusement park looked popular but we felt that the whole place was too hot and noisy. We took the enclosed cable car on the way down. It felt rather hot inside and the reflections on the plastic walls made taking photos difficult.",
?곸뼱,Jun-15,2,"Disappointing! Why indeed? While I understand the French colonist built something here, why rebuild what's already destroyed?  The cable car ride is nice.... Do note there's 2 lines... Take the with the glass bottom... It's quite scenic rides with views for waterfalls, streams....  Once on top, it's just expensive restaurants, cafes... Can skip.... The nice cool air is however spoilt by many smokers.... Just like in all typical Asian countries, many are puffing furiously to improve tobacco companies' already fat profits.  Skip if you have limited time in Hoi An and Danang...",
?곸뼱,Jun-15,1,"Bana Hills Morin Restaurant tried to cheat customer Dear travellers, while i am writing this review , i am still in Bana Hills living in the french Village in the 4 star hotel on 19 June 2015. I am sharing a very bad experience that i just had and would like to share so that those who would like to visit bana hills would think twice. I have had dinner at this Morin Restaurant and have ordered a set menu with the Beijing Roast duck. However , when it was serve, the meat looks alot like chicken and Both me and my wife ask the waitress if it was really chicken. The waitress who has served the same menu for many times replied that it was indeed chicken and confirm with us the second time. I believe most of us can taste the difference between a chicken and a duck. When we tasted it and confirm that it was chicken, the waitress kept refuting that it was chicken. We demanded that she check with the kitchen and when she check and came back and tell us indeed it was chicken. We had complained to the manager Nguyen Cuu Tien of the restaurant and all they can say is the staff lack training. I am not sure if everything was planned out to cheat foreigner customers.  If both my wife has not persisted on our judgement , we would have been cheated. I hereby urge all travellers to thinktwice staying in Bana Hills and eating out at the restaurants there. The whole resort including hotels and restaurants belongs to the same owner.",
?곸뼱,Jun-15,2,"Ba Na Hills only worth it for the cable car ride Well worth the cable car ride as amazing scenery rainforest etc..but when you get to top very overrated and commercialised...basically a dressed up fun park. There is a French village with shops but not a lot to choose from and a bit pricey. The drive from Danang to where you pick up cable car is about 45 minutes. Be prepared for long queues from the car park to the cable car.. We lined up in very hot conditions for 45 minutes so take this into account if travelling with young children. Also doesnt appear you can take strollers on cable cars. Cable car trip to top takes about 20 minutes. Once you get to the top it is so much cooler. Buffet below average and very crowded but it is summer holidays here. The Fantasy Park had free rides included in your admission price and these were average but young children would enjoy. Though we did enjoy the 4D experience and dodgem cars. We travelled to this attraction as a couple on a tour organised outside our hotel through the BaNa Hills Resort.. Couldnt fault the courtesy on pick up, during the drive there and during our visit and was dropped back to our hotel. Was a lot less crowded coming down in the cable car in the afternoon as people leaving at different times to go home.",
?곸뼱,Apr-15,2,"Under construction This trip was recommended to us, and this is the first time I took a decision without doing some research first. The ride with the cable car was ok, nice view, but so far my enthusiasm. It looked like an attempt to create a crappy amusement park, and I say 'create', because this thing is far from finished. Construction was going on everywhere. Everything looked so fake, and most of all, boring! Wasted 2 hours and way to much money on this.",
?곸뼱,Feb-15,1,Ba(d) Na Hills Ba Na Hills.. where to begin? The hill itself is not bad. The view is decent and the cablecar is good and efficient.  However don't be fooled by the promise of Fantasy Park. As of Feb 2015 it's merely a facade with close to nothing open.  Also don't expect to be able to pay for anything with creditcard. Only cash is accepted throughout the mountaintop location.  Not recommended.,
?곸뼱,Jan-15,1,"Crowded and expensive ticket! I have to wait half an hour to buy ticket and 2 hours waiting cable. So tired. Landscape is so so, ticket is about 24$ and food is so expensive!",
?곸뼱,Jan-15,1,"Horrendous destruction of beautyful forest The worst-of-the-worst. Horrendous destruction of natural forest to make place for a tasteless disney-land entertainment hell, completely isolated from its natural environment (literally: you cannot see forest from inside the entertainment 'castle'). The place could be in the middle of Danang, and nobody would notice the difference. The worst mass-tourism site I've seen in a long time. Huge crowds of noisy visitors oblivious of and not interested in the beauty just meters away. You're a captive audience, so restaurants and cafes can charge anything for the ""food"" they serve. The cable car is fairly expensive (about USD 25 pp plus another USD 3.50 pp to get to the start of the returning cable car). And half the time the summit is in the mist, so no views.  Won't see me back there.",
?곸뼱,Oct-14,2,"Good for views but not in the rainy season Went here on a half day trip from a conference in Da Nang. The cable car system and funicular are impressive for those of use that dont have much of that kind of thing at home. The attractions at the top are a unique combination of French 16th century castle, Hogwarts and minor amusement park as envisioned by a pre-Glasnost Soviet architect. If you're a tourist - it is not worth the trip to see those. There are some interesting religious buildings on the summit and the near-by hill tops but there was almost no non-vietnamese signage and not much in the guidebooks. The view can be great apparently - but we failed to check that these can disappear in the rainy season, It gets popular and very busy, so go early if you are going to go. Definitely one for the locals.",
?곸뼱,Nov-14,1,"Badly built theme park Great views, if the clouds lift and a great cable car up to the site. This is a tacky, badly built faux French theme park. If you stay there's only one restaurant open at night and it's terrible. You have been warned!!!",

Totally disappointing and even our daughter thought it was poor...except the cable car ride (but really, there need to be more on offer). Cant understand how this place can get good reviews, honestly.",
?곸뼱,Jun-14,2,"Average Kitch Came here with our 5 year old son. The ride up, although maybe one of the longest cable cars in the world, wasn't very scenic. Up top is very little other than some kitchy features and a few rides for kids. Food services was limited and overall the whole thing just seemed poorly run. Would not really recommend.",
?곸뼱,Nov-14,1,"Poor service, poor treatment we arranged many groups to Ba Na Hill, but our guide team always faced with a problem about the ticket on arrival, even we booked in advance. When our tour guide check in at the entrance with the ticket code, they said it is wrong code and not allowed for the group coming. Another group, we have to contact many times with sales office to handle this problem while our group waiting for hour at entrance! They don't care the tourist group and don't care customer ! Poor service !",
?곸뼱,Sep-14,2,"Wierd The cable car ride up and down the mountain was beautiful, peaceful and very pleasant. The 'resort' or 'theme park' at the top was simply bizarre- A concrete Parisian replica village!!! The kids did enjoy the rides which were cheap (all in one ticket)",
?곸뼱,Sep-14,2,"Not worth the money The place is expensive compered to what you get, and in addition, it's still under renovations so some part of park is closed and of course that they don't let you know in advance. Most of the attractions there are for kids, or older people in the mood for a silly time.  The thing that annoyed me the most was the fact that you had to buy a ticket to the train in order to see the flower garden, although you can go there by foot.. They just closed the entrance, and again did say from the start that this will cost more money..",

You can still walk around and see some beautiful Buddhist shrines and temples and the hotel looks cool, but the development is taking its toll. One goes into the restaurant with high hopes but often leaves disappointed (I have 3 times). I've stayed in the hotel once and it too was a let down. Non-locking doors, dingy rooms and a 2 star feel left me wishing for more.",
?곸뼱,Jul-14,2,"Okay ride but nothing at the top The cable car ride is okay if you can bear the rude tourists who aren't used to queuing and constantly pushing in at every opportunity. And it doesn't get any better at the top.  There isn't much to see and do once you get to the top, but judging by the amount of local tourists this must be like there Disneyland or Dreamworld (albeit not what we'd expected).",
?곸뼱,Jul-14,2,"Say Nah to B횪 N횪 Hills Since this place is designed for tourists, my wife and I decided to give it a shot since we are in 휂횪 N梳탇g, big mistake. We took a cab from our hotel (close to M沼?Kh챗 Beach) and it costs us $550K VND for round trip through Mai Linh Taxi. You can do one way and most drivers will offer $400K VND.  B횪 N횪 is full of tourists but 99% are Vietnamese tourists. The reason is most of its attractions appeal to people who live in VN. As a Vietnamese-American living in California, I find that this place has a long way to go to become a desirable destination for Westerners. It is not quite enough to compare to theme parks like Disneyland or Six Flags, etc. Vietnamese travelers marvel at its fountain, recently made castles and gardens while I went ""meh!"".  You pay $500K VND per person to ride the cable car up the hills. The view up is quite spectacular. You can get a great view of the beach, the city, the rain forest, and waterfalls. We also saw some pretty exotic and colorful birds flew by. As the elevation rises, the weather gets colder. Pretty cool. However, as we went in the late afternoon, we also encountered heavy rain and fog as we got to the top. Hence we could not see a thing nor explored the gardens when we were there. People said you'll less likely get rain when you go early in the morning.  They charge $70K/person once you get to the top if you want to explore the D'Amour Garden and the wine cellar. It was pouring and we didn't care for the cellar so we decided to save the money. There's also some sort of arcade/amusement park which costs additional money so we said nah as well. That left us with the option of overpriced food and giant crowds. We decided to head back down.  The problem with popular Vietnamese tourist destinations such as this is they attract large Vietnamese crowds from all walks of life. While there we were exposed to large herds of people who lack the manners that westerners are accustomed to. People will shove to get in front of you in line. They will talk loudly and allow their children to scream, cry, and run around without supervision. While in the cable car with 6 other people, we were exposed to a screaming child, a woman who takes off her shoes to put up her feet, a man who decided it was too hot to keep his shirt on and started to scratch himself. Close quarters with these people was too much for me.  In conclusion, say ""nah!"" To B횪 N횪.",
?곸뼱,Jul-14,2,"Bad. Just bad! The cable car is amazing and scenery was beautiful BUT I wish we had just turned back around and gone down the mountain.  This park is perfect for people who don't like personal space, love to be pushed or shoved and want to spend a lot of money. Very few of the rides / attractions are free and food was bland and boring. We were not impressed at all! On top of that I was nearly bowled over numerous times by pushy children whose parents don't seem to care about controlling them.  I do not recommend spending the time or money here.",
?곸뼱,Jun-14,2,"Great view but nothing more This was the worst attraction I have been to in Vietnam. I don't mean to stereotype, but Asian people have there own way of queuing, which is to try and get to the front, and disregard accepted queuing etiquette. This had me in a bad mood from the start, but there was more to come. The theme park at the top was quite frankly ridiculous. A four story monster of a building filled with screaming children, run down arcade games and rides lay at the top of the mountain. I am still not sure why they thought it would be good to put an indoor attraction at the top of this marvellous hill, but alas, they have. At the top there are also a number of Russian food outlets, which were all overpriced, and packed full of people. The whole trip had virtually no english, and the rigmarole of finding the right cable car to take you half the way back down was shocking, with guards forcing you to walk the long way everywhere. I couldn't wait to get back down once I got up there, and for 500,000 (foreigner) for a trip on a cable car this was an absolute rought. If you are over 16, you will most likely hate this place, do yourself a favour and save the hassle and expense and stay in Da Nang. The attractions at the top are extremely incongruous with the surrounding nature, and perhaps more of a focus on the wildlife and trees of Vietnam would be a step in the right direction, rather than an oversized shopping mall with inedible food that requires a bank loan.  On the positive side I enjoyed the cable car ride, there were great views and it felt very safe. If only they had a discounted rate for people who want to stay on the cable car and come down without stopping at the wretched 'attractions' at the top.",

Try to get a car to yourself as ride takes about 20 minutes. At the Buddha statue and at top of hill you are literally walking through a construction site. There is reason the promo pictures all look like cartoons! The whole area should be closed until they complete construction. Tourists should not be walking through such a mess.

?곸뼱,Nov-13,2,Bizarre One of those Asian things that seem popular. The cable car is apparently the longest and highest in the world. Expensive by Vietnamese standards at almost $25AUD. And you have to get there about 50kms out of Da Nang.t The day we went it was pouring and within 5 minutes all we could see was mist. Our fault. At the top was a bizarre fun parlour. A third rate Luna Park at the top of a mountain. Who would go there at the top of the mountain. Judging by the gates for queues for the cable car it seems in peak season perhaps thousands. If you like to go rock climbing indoors at the top of a mountain or play racing car games great. If you go for the view and I am sure it is beautiful pick a fine day.,
?곸뼱,Oct-13,2,"Hardly worth visiting I came here with a tour group. Apparently if you buy your own entry ticket, it would cost you about 700thousand dong. This cover the entry and average buffet.  The only fascinating thing about this place is the cable ride and the view. The temple was pretty nice too. But the rest of the attractions was abit tired looking, lame and boring. You also have to pay extra for all these games and rides.  We just visited vinpearl in nha trang a week ago and for a 500thousand dong, all the games and rides were free. It also has beach and water parks. Having been to vinpearl, bana hills seem to be nothing in comparison.",

However, it was waste of time and money with most of building still on construction and least entertainment at the top of Ba Na Hills.

?곸뼱,Dec-12,2,"Hit and Miss The hits - well the cable car ride is nice, the cars are in good condition, everything seems reasonably well organised. I'm sure the view from the top is as as fabulous as the pictures suggest.  The misses - about USD 50 round trip cab ride there, ok could go cheaper on a tour, another USD 20 a head for the cable car. But most of all, it's a gamble with the weather. We saw almost nothing, despite leaving Danang in sunshine, due to clouds surrounding the whole area. After that, there's really not much to do. A few nice pagodas, an indoor amusement arcade, a few debatable food outlets. Most of the area is still under a state of construction. Plus the cable car turns on and off at certain times during the day, but they do tell you about it. We learnt that once we arrived, a lovely 1h 15 wait to go up, with precious little to do at the base bar a restaurant with 3 dishes on the menu, a huge souvenir shop and some very limited trails.  The ride itself is around 20 min to the first station, then switch to slightly smaller cable car for another 5 mins, it's possible to walk between the two upper stations.  I'm pretty sure my opinion would have been so much more positive had we been able to see a view. Given all the travelling time required (30mins from Danang) and the waiting, I think I'd need some convincing though.",
?곸뼱,Nov-12,1,"Waste of Money and Time The Cable Car Ride was not worth the money. The Taxi to get there was extortionate, and the view at the top was not as good as it was made out to be. At the top of the ride, there was a replica of a French Village. Inside was a children's theme park which was very poor. The place was empty and the staff were not helpful or polite.  Worst attraction I have came across after travelling South East Asia over 2 months.",
?곸뼱,Nov-12,1,"Nothing at top, very expensive for Vietnam Granted the ride to the top has some nice scenery but we found we could't see much due to the fog! It is expensive to get to from Da Nang in taxi costing 1 million return and then the cable car ride was 400,000 dong. The cable cars smelt unpleasant and the town at the top was tacky with only a few rides for children and nowhere remotely decent to eat. This was the most disappointing trip in South East Asia so far!",
?곸뼱,Oct-12,2,"Badly managed We Drove the 30km trip out to Ba Na hill. the brouchures were'nt overly clear about the running time of the cable car. had a bit of a wait but down the bottom while we waited for the cable cars to open but not too bad.They only operate at at set times. the view going up is amazing, beautiful lush green jungle, waterfalls and a pretty good view over some of the city. i dont normally write many negative reviews but i write this more so others are aware.  the view is about where it all ends. there is a second cable car which takes you to the main area. really at the top there is nothing. everything is under construction and there are only resorts. there is a fantasy land but its more suited to children/teens.  the cable cars stop for varying periods over the day. the lady at the bottom said we could come back at any time so took this to mean that coming down was continueous. so we didnt really take notice of the timetable (which is in vietnamese). this was the start of our terrible trip trying to get to the borrom. you cant walk from the first hill to the second so we just had to wait the half hour for the cars to be turned back on. we had a taxi waiting for us down the bottom so we needed to be back by a certain time.the first wait was annoying but bareable. we finally got down to the second hill for the main cable car down to the bottom and this was also now closed. the man said 'ok, ok come back in 1.5 hours) we couldn't believe that they shut off the only way of getting down for this long!!! hardly anyone spoke english, i know im in a non-english speaking country but it is atourist area. there was a massive line for the cars 1 hour before they were due to open again. the first part of the hill has nothing on it. no restaurants or activities so its pretty boring. finally they opened about half an hour before they were supposed to.  basically the timetable says what times it is open, but it doesnt have the last trip, so if it closes at 12.30 you can only get on until about 12.15 or before. basically we felt trapped up there with no timetable in english and noone who could really explain anything. cable cars close for 45 mins to an hour at a time.  nice view going up but id stay on the cable car and go straight back down again. maybe when all the construction is finished there might be something to do up there but for now, its not worth being stuck up there with no way of getting down. Maybe we just had a bad experience, but as a warning if you do go up, make sure you know the timetable and be early or the cable cars especially if you're on a time limit!!!",
?곸뼱,Oct-12,1,"Just awful Don't waste your time, money and energy. Once you get up there, there is nothing to do except wait for the next car down. Which takes two hours, as they stop the lifts!!! There is no food to speak of, so we just waited on some steps for two hours... worst experience ever. Oh an to top it off I got scammed by the taxi driver on the way back.",
?곸뼱,Aug-12,2,"Hideous, Disney-like development. Looking for some mountain vistas and a bit of country side, we drove to the Ba Na hill station. Original plans for Bach Ma were cancelled due to road construction closures. the base of the mountain had blaring western pop music and a large fountain, synched to the music. the cable car was expensive and takes you to a fake French castle resort. the views were nice when not interrupted by cables and construction. A waste of half a day.",
?곸뼱,Jul-12,2,"Contrasting Values The worlds longest cable car draws you ever up into a world class natural tropical rainforest mountain environmental spotted with significant historic relics from a previous colonial era.  What a shame that this is being built into a Disneyland theme park!  While apparently popular with locals, I don't think this massive new development will have much to offer to international visitors - particularly those from Europe.  Don't go during school and public holiday periods. The cable car traffic is chaotic.",
?곸뼱,Apr-12,2,"Not worth going There is nothing of significance at the hills. The theme park, if you are into that sort of thing, is still under construction, but from what I can see, it is nothing to shout about. The hotels are hugely disappointing. There is nothing to do at night - for dinner, there is only 1 restaurant. If you do happen to go, do not stay overnight!",
?곸뼱,Apr-12,2,"Very Disapointed W e had seen reports about Da Na Hills and the cable car and decided to go take a look, at the bottom it is totally unappealing with a dated caf챕 and car parks for what can only be the hope for the future traffic. The cable car in itself is an amazing feet of engineering, but once you get over that!!!!! Well that?셲 it. The Vietnamese are building want can only be described as a very kitsch theme park at the top and once you get over the aw off getting all the materials up there, that is it, it?셲 just another ?쏷HEME PARK??don?셳 waste your money ??there is so much else to see and do in Vietman!",
?곸뼱,Mar-12,1,Wasted money and time!! all buiding is under construction! very dusty and small! waste time with waste money with charge USD15 for the cable car! no worth for the higher fees charges!,
?곸뼱,Dec-11,2,"Not nice when raining. Don`t go there with poor weather. You can not see anything. At the moment the whole peak is a construction yard, so there is not much to see anyway. The fantasy park is terrible. Do not waste your time. The cable car itself is awsome.",
?곸뼱,Nov-11,2,"Dont visit until 2013 We (2 couples) visited this attraction on Nov 13 with a driver from Da Nang who was supposed to speack English and didnt. We paid the agreed price at the hotel before we left and it was supposed to include the price to ride the cable car to the top of the mountain but were not given a voucher. When we got to the cable car station it was difficult to explain that we had already paid, but eventually the girl realised and booked the cost to the hotel. The cable car is very impressive - longest and steepest in the world, in two sections. At the top was a construction site with very little signage except advertising the Fantasy Park grand opening in 2013! Access tracks to the mountain top were not signed but we did find the swing bridge with a little exploring. The Fantasy Land main building was open for busines (but still under construction) with amazing decor and fun park rides that would suit all tastes (if that is what you expect at a mountain resort!!) The cable cars only run rides up and down at certain times so we were stuck at the top of the mountain (or second station) for an hour or so without anything to see or do and no proper cafe. We were told at the top by a hostess that we could get a car ride to another part o the mountain for free to see the white budda and old colonial villas but the road was totaly closed because of construction so it was all an expensive waste of time. Dont visit until construction is complete in 2013 unless you want to just do the cable car ride and wait for hours.",
?곸뼱,Nov-11,1,"Waste of time & unprofessional staff This is nothing but a man made set up - not natural scenery. If interested in theme park and ready to pay $15 for 2 hour of time waste experience, you should go there. Its probably for people who havent seen theme parks, entertainment areas in their life much. Moreover if your dont take gondola at the right time slot - its possible you will be stuck at level 2 (where first gondola drops you off) - there is nothing to see, nothing to do at this level. Staff is very unprofessional - they didnt start the 2nd Gondola and were laughing/giggling amoung themselves when we asked them to do so. Please note that our request was nothing ""out of ordinary""... It was the scheduled time to start the Gondola. Anyways...Ended up wasting 3~4 hours of time & Money. Definitely think thrice before you go there. No one speaks english and when we talked to manager on phone he shouted back.",
